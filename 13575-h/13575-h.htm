<h3><a name="preface">PREFACE</a></h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>This Handbook is intended primarily for the use of travellers in
the Near and Middle East who are interested in antiquities without
being already trained archaeologists. It is the outcome of a
recommendation made by the Archaeological Joint Committee, a body
recently established, on the initiative of the British Academy and
at the request of the Foreign Office, to focus the knowledge and
experience of British scholars and archaeologists and to place it
at the disposal of the Government when advice or information is
needed upon matters connected with archaeological science. The
Committee is composed of representatives of the principal English
societies connected with Archaeology, and it is hoped that it may
be recognized as the natural body of reference, both for Government
Departments and for the public, on matters connected with
archaeological research in foreign lands. It represents no one
institution and no one interest. Its purpose is to protect the
interests of archaeological science, to secure a sane and
enlightened administration of antiquities in the lands which are
now being more fully opened to research, and to promote the advance
of knowledge in the spheres to which its competence extends.</p>

<p>One means of serving this cause is to provide information for
the guidance of travellers in the lands of antiquity. Much
knowledge is lost because it comes in the way of those who do not
know how to profit by it or to record it. Accordingly, just as the
Natural History Museum has issued a series of pamphlets of advice
to the collectors of natural history specimens, so it has been
thought that a handbook of elementary information and advice may be
found of service by travellers with archaeological tastes; and the
Trustees of the British Museum have undertaken the publication of
it. The handbook has been prepared by a number of persons, whose
competence is beyond dispute; and the thanks of all who find it
useful are due to Mr. G. F. Hill (who has acted as general editor
as well as part author), Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie, Mr. D. G.
Hogarth, Prof. J. L. Myres, Mr. J. G. C. Anderson, Mr. J. P. Droop,
Prof. R. A. S. Macalister, Mr. H. R. Hall, Mr. A. J. B. Wace, Mr.
0. M. Dalton, Mr. R. L. Hobson, Mr. E. J. Forsdyke, Mr. A. H.
Smith, Mr. R. A. Smith, Mr. A. B. Cook, and Prof. G. A. Cooke. Each
contributor has been left considerable latitude as to the method of
treatment of the subject allotted to him, and no attempt has been
made to bring the various sections into uniformity of pattern.
Owing to Prof. Petrie's absence in Egypt, it has not been possible
to submit final proofs of his contributions to him.</p>

<p>Suggestions for improvement in future editions will be welcomed,
and will no doubt be forthcoming as the result of experience.
Meanwhile it is hoped that this little book will accompany many
travellers in foreign lands, and that the labour expended on it
will bear fruit in the improved observation and record of
archaeological data, in establishing sound principles for the
administration of antiquities, and in enforcing proper methods of
excavation and conservation. It may also be found of service by
those who study the results of research as they appear in
museums.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="intro">INTRODUCTORY</a></h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The hints which it is the object of this volume to convey are
not meant for experienced archaeologists. They are rather addressed
to those who, while anxious to observe and record the antiquities
which they may see on their travels, are likely, owing to lack of
training, to miss things that may be of importance, or, having
observed them, to bring home an imperfect record. It is hoped also
that they may catch the attention of some of those who are not
interested in the subject, but, coming into possession of
antiquities, may unwittingly do incalculable harm by allowing them
to be destroyed or dispersed before any record has been made.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, of the countries with which we are concerned,
have their Laws of Antiquities. It cannot be too strongly insisted
that those laws, even if they might be better than they are, should
be obeyed by the traveller. He should familiarize himself with
their main provisions, which are summarized in an Appendix. The
traveller who makes it his object to loot a country of its
antiquities, smuggling objects out of it and disguising the sources
from which they are obtained, does a distinct dis&ndash;service to
archaeological science. Although he may enrich collections, public
or private, half or more than half of the scientific value of his
acquisitions is destroyed by the fact that their provenance is kept
secret or falsely stated. Such action is equivalent to tearing out
whole pages from a history and destroying them for ever, for each
antiquity, whatever it may be, is in its way a part of history,
whether of politics, arts, or civilization. For the same reason
anything like unauthorized excavation, especially by unskilled
hands, is gravely to be deprecated. To dig an ancient site
unskilfully or without keeping a proper record is to obliterate
part of a manuscript which no one else will ever be able to read.
The tendency of recent legislation is to allow more generous terms
in the matter of licences for export to excavators and collectors,
and the harsher provisions of some of the existing laws are likely
soon to be amended.</p>

<p>Before leaving home, the traveller will be well advised to make
inquiries at the museums or at the head&ndash;quarters of the
archaeological societies which concern themselves specially with
the places which he intends to visit. A list of these museums and
societies is appended to this section (<a href="#l-1">p. 26</a>). It
is hardly
necessary to warn him that archaeological training cannot be
acquired in a few days, and that he will have to buy his experience
in various ways; but the more time he can devote to working through
the collections in this country, the more useful will be his
observations abroad. He will be able to learn what kind of
antiquities it is especially desirable to look for, not merely with
the object of filling gaps in the public collections, but for the
advancement of archaeological knowledge in general.</p>

<p>The object of archaeological travel and excavation is not to
collect antiquities so that they may be arranged according to the
existing catalogues of museums, but to collect fresh information to
amplify and correct what we now know, to make our knowledge of the
past more complete and useful.</p>

<p>On arrival in the country of his choice, he is recommended to
continue at the National Museum the study, which we suppose he has
already begun in the museums at home, of the kind of antiquities
which he is likely to come across. But he should also take an early
opportunity of getting into touch with the local British
Archaeological School or other similar institution, where he will
receive advice what to look for and where and how to look, and
assistance in procuring suitable equipment. Thus the traveller who
starts from Athens or Jerusalem should apply at the British School
of Archaeology. He may there, it he desires, receive instruction in
any of the methods described in Chapter II, in which a little
practical demonstration is worth pages of print, and will be given
all possible assistance in obtaining such articles of equipment as
are available on the spot. (Photographic supplies and all
scientific instruments should be brought out from England.) The
best maps of the district will also be accessible for examination
(but the traveller is recommended to make inquiries in this respect
before leaving England); the libraries will provide the literature
dealing with the routes he proposes to take; and such a collection
as the type&ndash;series of pottery and the Finlay collection of
prehistoric antiquities at the British School at Athens may be
useful to supplement his previous studies at museums, and enable
him to observe with intelligence the potsherds, &amp;c., that he
may find on an ancient site. In return, he will be expected to
report his results either to the School or to some other scientific
society or museum at home. It should be unnecessary to remind him
that the conditions of the law of the land relating to the
reporting of discoveries to the competent authorities should be
strictly observed. Such authorities should also be informed of any
destruction or removal of monuments which may be noticed.</p>

<p>Another matter which should not be neglected is the obtaining of
such licences as may be required by law for the acquisition in the
country or export therefrom of objects of antiquity. Advice on this
matter can be obtained at the local School or National Museum.</p>

<p>It is possible that the traveller will begin his journey at a
point other than the capital. Inquiries should be made at the
London head&ndash; quarters of the Schools concerning residents at
such places who may be able to give advice to intending
travellers.</p>

<p>The traveller will doubtless bring back with him such
antiquities as he is permitted to export. A word of general advice
on this matter may not be out of place here. The essential value of
antiquities, apart from their purely artistic interest, lies in the
circumstances in which they are found. The inexperienced traveller
is apt to pick up a number of objects haphazard, without accurately
noting their find&ndash;spots, and even, getting tired of them, as
a child of flowers that he has picked, to discard them a mile or
two away. If the first act is a blunder, the second is a crime; it
is better to leave them lying in place. For the same reason, it is
highly desirable that objects found together (e.g. the contents of
a tomb) should as far as possible be kept together, or at least
that accurate record of the whole group should be made, since the
archaeological value of a find may depend on a single object,
apparently of small importance. Nothing, for instance, is more
common, or more distressing to the numismatist, than the division
of a hoard of coins among various persons before they have been
examined by an expert. If they must be divided, good impressions
should at least be made by one of the methods described in Chapter
II, and, if the coins are of gold or silver, the weights should be
noted. This should be done even if the coins, to the inexperienced
eye, appear to be all alike. The knowledge that any coin from a
hoard may be of greater value than a similar coin found singly may
induce finders to report such finds before dispersing them. What
applies to coins is equally applicable, in various ways, to all
classes of antiquities.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the primary object of the traveller is not
speculation in the pecuniary value of the antiquities that he may
acquire, although he may be not unreasonably inclined to recover
some of his expenses by disposing of objects which do not appeal to
him. Should that be so, although the authorities of public museums
obviously cannot be agents or valuers in such transactions between
the owner and private collectors, they are as obviously willing to
consider offers which are made to their museums in the first
instance and, if the objects are not required by them, to advise
the owner in what quarter he may be likely to meet with a
purchaser.</p>

<br>
<h3>METHOD</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>1. Outfit.</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>Each traveller will require to provide for his special
interests; but for any archaeological work the following things are
desirable. Note&ndash;books of squared paper. Drawing&ndash;blocks
of blue&ndash;squared paper. Paper for wet squeezes, and for dry
squeezes. Brush for wet squeezes (spoke brush). One or two
so&ndash;metre tapes. A few bamboo gardening canes for markers in
planning. Divide one in inches or centimetres for measuring
buildings. A steel rod, 3 ft. x 1 inch for probing. Field&ndash;
glass, or low&ndash;power telescope. Prismatic compass with card
partly black, to see at night. Large and small celluloid
protractors for plotting angles on plans. Plotting&ndash;scale,
tenths of inches and millimetres. Maps of the district, the best
available. Aneroid barometer, if collecting flints; small size; can
be tested by observing in a tall lift, or by putting in a tumbler
and pressing the hand air&ndash;tight over the mouth. The zero
error, or absolute values, are not wanted for levelling, only
delicacy in small variations. Magnifiers, a few pocket size; will
also serve for presents. Indelible pencils, pens, and ink in strong
corked pocket bottle. Reservoir pens dry up too much in some
climates. China ink for permanent marking. Strips of adhesive
paper, about a inch and a inches wide, to put round objects for
labelling. Strong steel pliers, wire&ndash;cutting. A few
pocket&ndash;knives will serve for presents. It is best to carry
money in a little bag or screw of paper, loose in the jacket
pocket, it in a risky district. It can then be dropped on any alarm
and picked up afterwards.</p>

<p><b>Photographic.</b>[1] In the selection of a camera much will
depend upon the nature of the work to be undertaken, the conditions
of travel, and the climate to which the camera will be exposed. For
accurate work a stand camera is always to be preferred to one of
the hand variety, and care should be taken to choose an instrument
that is strongly made and of simple construction. The essentials of
a good stand camera are that it shall be rigid, possess a rising
and falling front, a swing back, and bellows which will be capable
of extension to fully double the focal length of the lens to be
used with it.</p>

<p><small>[1]Prof. Petrie is not responsible for this section,
which is due to the kind assistance of some professional
photographers.&ndash;ED.</small></p>

<p>The rising and falling front gives a power of modifying the
field of view in a vertical direction. The swing back preserves the
verticality of architectural subjects. In some cases, when used
with the pivots vertical, it is a help in focussing the subject.
The possible extension of the distance between the lens stop and
the ground glass to twice the focal length (which is as a rule the
distance between the same points, when a distant object is in
focus) enables a small subject to be reproduced in natural
size.</p>

<p>For work abroad where extremes of temperature or excessive
variations have to be contended with, a special tropical camera is
supplied by most of the leading makers. Its well&ndash;seasoned
hard wood and metal&ndash; bound joints render it suitable for hard
wear, and reduce the risk of leakage through warping or shrinkage.
The tripod stand should be of the so&ndash;called threefold
variety, with sliding legs which can be adapted to broken ground.
If a loose screw is used for attaching the camera to the stand, a
spare screw should be kept in reserve. It is important that this
stand should be strongly made, and light patterns subject to undue
vibrations in the wind should be discarded. For photographing small
objects in the studio, a small table is more convenient than a
tripod support. If the camera will not sit flat on the table, a bed
can easily be designed for it. Better work will be done if this is
prepared in advance than if an improvised support is used. As
regards the size of the outfit, quarter&ndash;plate (3 &frac14; x 4
&frac14; inches) will usually be found to be large enough for the
traveller. For anything in the nature of studio work in a museum or
in connexion with an excavation a half&ndash;plate camera (6
&frac12; x 4 &frac34; inches) is more satisfactory. Where a hand
camera is preferred it should be one capable of adjustment of
focus, and here again, strength and simplicity should be looked
for. It should be provided with effective tripod legs, for studied
exposures. Plates or flat films are preferable to roll fills [2]
which are difficult to manipulate away from home. Flat films are
less bulky and less breakable than glass, and can be sent by post.
They are supplied by the makers in packs of 12 for daylight loading
into a film&ndash;pack adapter, which must be provided to take the
place of the ordinary dark slides for glass plates. The lens should
be a modern anastigmatic by a good maker. A focal length of about
six inches will be best for a quarter&ndash;plate camera. A bad
lens makes success impossible even by accident.</p>

<p><small>[2] Transcriber's note: 'fills' in the original text is
possibly a misprint for 'films'.</small></p>

<p>The stops will probably be of the Iris pattern, incorporated in
the lens and so not likely to be lost, as often happens with loose
stops.</p>

<p>A few words on the theory and use of the stops and on the
F&ndash;notation may be of service. The speed of a photographic
lens depends on the ratio of the effective aperture to the focal
length. Thus any two lenses used at apertures of F/8, that is at
apertures having diameters one&ndash;eighth of their respective
focal lengths, should be of the same speed, though both lenses and
apertures may be very different. In a given lens, the speed varies
directly with the area of the aperture admitting the light, that is
with the square of the diameter of the aperture. The series of
stops usually employed is calculated so that each aperture is half
the area of the preceding. Stated in terms of the focal length they
are known as F/5.6, F/8, F/11.3, F/16, F/22.6, F/32, &amp;c. Since
the squares of those numbers, 31.4, 64, 127.7, 256, 510.7, 1024 are
approximately each twice the preceding number of the series, the
apertures, F(ocal length), divided by the successive numbers as
denominators, are each half the area of the preceding and require
twice the exposure, F/16 requires twice the 'exposure of F/11.3,
and four times that of F/8, and so throughout the scale.</p>

<p>Stops are used to regulate either 'depth of focus' or length of
exposure. The 'depth of focus' means the distance before and behind
the point in theoretically accurate focus, at which objects are
sufficiently focussed, for the purpose the photographer has in
view. This length is greatest when only the central portion of the
lens is in use. It is greatest with a pinhole, and least with a
full aperture. Hence a small stop is required if the picture is to
include near and far objects, while a large aperture may be used if
all the subject is far enough away to be in clear focus&mdash;say
more than 25 feet&mdash;or if it is a flat surface. The small stop
is also required when the rising front or the swing back is in use.
The power of regulating the time of exposure is convenient for
shortening long exposures in dark interiors, or for lengthening
inconveniently short exposures in a bright light.</p>

<p>In practice it will be best to become familiar with the use of
about three stops, say the full aperture (perhaps F/5.6 or F/8),
F/16, and F/32.</p>

<p>For judging long exposures, the use of an actinometer (issued in
many inexpensive forms) is helpful.</p>

<p>A telephoto attachment increases the photographer's power of
rendering distant details on a large scale. The results are greatly
superior to enlargements of a small plate. It is, however, useless
in a wind, unless the camera is specially supported, and is
otherwise rather tricky to use. The traveller is strongly advised
to master its management at home. It should be adjusted by the
maker to the camera for which it is intended.</p>

<p>Unless a photographer's dark room can be had the developing of
the bulk is best left until the return home, but tests should be
made to see that the exposures are correct. A piece of ruby fabric
or ruby paper tied over an electric light will give a safe light
after dark, and 'Scalol' or some such one&ndash;solution developer
which requires merely the addition of water, will give all that is
needed for developing. For fixing use 4 oz. hypo to a pint of
water.</p>

<p>In warm climates, use cold water. If it is not cool enough, the
gelatine of the negatives may give trouble. In that case, get
colder water, and use an alum bath. If water is precious, plates
can be sufficiently washed by moving them forward in succession,
through half&ndash;dozen soup plates filled with water.</p>

<p>If habitual use is not made of tabloid developers, &amp;c., it
is advisable to have some in reserve, for use in the case of broken
bottles and spilt solutions.</p>

<p class= "centclass"><em>Useful notes and maxims.</em></p>

<p>An over&ndash;exposed plate gives no dark shadows in the
print.</p>

<p>An under&ndash;exposed plate gives no high lights. When in
doubt, choose the risk of over&ndash;exposure.</p>

<p>To test the safety of your camera&mdash;Half draw the shutter,
and expose part of the plate in the camera, in the sunshine,
without uncapping the lens, and develop.</p>

<p>To test the safety of your red light&mdash;Expose a plate,
divide it into two, develop half in the dark, and half for the same
time, with the same solution by the light you are testing, and
compare the results. This test is worth making, as photographers
are apt to give themselves much discomfort from exaggerated
caution.</p>

<h4>2. Itinerary.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>Where there are efficient maps the only need is to mark in the
position of any antiquities, by cross&ndash;bearings to clear
points, with the compass, drawn in with a sharp pencil. Where the
maps are too small, or deficient, a continuous register of time
should be made, noting the minute of starting and of stopping; this
over known distances will serve to give the value over the unknown.
Note whether mounted or walking, and the compass bearing of the
track; also the bearings of known points around, whenever stopping.
Without any known bearings pacing and compass used carefully may go
over the roughest ground without five per cent. error in the
day.</p>

<p>It is better when on unknown ground to plot a map as you go, so
that no misunderstanding of notes can arise after. If a squared
block cannot be used, at least draw the bearings and distances
roughly, writing in the amounts. This should be plotted up
accurately in the evening. A photograph may be unintelligible later
in its detail. It is best where known features, a temple, tombs,
&amp;c., are in a view, to sketch the outline when photographing,
and write in the details, so as to give a key to the photograph.
Inquire about antiquities whenever stopping. When camping,
villagers usually come up to see who it is; then tell them the
directions of the places around. They will ask how you know; show
them the map, and they are puzzled; talk over all the names a few
miles round, and then anything notable in the district may be
remarked, and inquiries made. Several men together help each other
to remember, and bring out more remarks. Sometimes an intelligent
man will describe all the antiquities he knows in the district:
this should be followed closely on the map, and difficulties
resolved at once, so as to get a clear record noted.</p>

<p>Of course, enormous exaggerations are met with, and not one
report in ten will prove to be anything. Tracking up the source of
bought antiquities is one of the best methods, and the one by which
Naukratis was found.</p>

<p>If travelling by camel, it is practicable to diverge widely on
foot, if objects are looked for well ahead. A foot track diverging
4.5 degrees, and then converging likewise, will easily keep in
touch with a baggage camel. Fix on the camping&ndash;place in the
morning, and let every one know of it, so that if accidentally
parted all can rejoin by night.</p>
<h4>3. Recording.</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Buildings or ruins.</b> Fix position by bearings to mapped
points; also note bearings of any prominent feature near by, which
may serve for finding the position again. Sketch a plan, always
north up in the book, note bearing of main wall, and then measure
with bamboo rod all original dimensions, with some diagonals to fix
angles; do not forget the thickness of the walls. It is best for a
long length to stretch a tape, pegged down by the ring, and pulled
tight by hand: read off all positions of doors, windows,
cross&ndash;walls, &amp;c., on one long length, and not as separate
short lengths. If possible plot the measures on squared paper as
you go, and then any errors or omissions will be checked at once.
'E. and O.E.' has no place in a plan.</p>

<p><b>Town mounds.</b> Estimate height over bare land outside; eye
height is a trifle over five feet. At the foot of the mound see
where the horizon cuts the shoulder of it to find eye height; walk
up to that point, and sight another five feet; so on, till you see
over the top. If there is any section, by a stream side, or
digging, or land&ndash;slip, look for strata, stone or brick walls
and floor levels, and for any distinctive potsherds; observing
levels as before. Look all over the top for potsherds, to find the
latest period of the town. Look around the mound for any early
potsherds. Sherds on the slopes are worth less; as they have
probably slipped down. Red burnt brick in Egypt is all Roman or
Arab; in Greece and Asia Minor, red brick and mortar is Roman,
Byzantine, or later.</p>

<p>Walk to the middle of the site or mound, and see its extent.
Then walk round the wall line, or circuit of it, pacing and compass
noting, to sketch the shape and size of the site: especially look
for any straight lines of wall showing. Sometimes a mud&ndash;brick
wall may be entirely denuded away, yet the position is shown by the
sharp edge of the strew of potsherds on the surface.</p>

<p>Look for any slag&ndash;heaps; these are the remains of lime
burning, and show where stone buildings existed; sometimes
foundations still remain. Look for any recent pits or trenches;
these show where stone or burnt brick has been dug out in modern
times, and may give the position and plan of a temple or
church.</p>

<p>See if any rubbish mounds can be traced outside of the town
site; usually marked by a gentle walk&ndash;up slope, and a steep
thrown&ndash;down slope, and mainly consisting of pottery, e.g.
Monte Testaccio at Rome, and mounds east of Cairo.</p>

<p>Town sites rise in Egypt about forty inches a century, by the
dust, rubbish, and decay of mud&ndash;brick buildings. In Palestine
the rise is five feet a century, owing to the rains.</p>

<p><b>Cemeteries.</b> These have generally been more or less
plundered; if recently, the pits show; if anciently, there are
scraps of pottery lying about. If there are pebbles or marl thrown
up from deep levels, there is evidence of tombs, and they may be
unplundered. Blown sand or grass may hide all trace of tombs.
Sometimes the whole masonry of a tomb may have been removed, and
the gravel filling&ndash;in have spread so uniformly that there is
no sign of building, although a course or two of stone may yet
remain under the surface. The surface of ground should be closely
looked over at sunrise or sunset to show up the slight hollows or
ridges by the shadows. After rain differences will often appear in
the drying of the ground. Ask any one near a site if he knows of
any one getting stones, or bronze, or plunder from tombs. Anything
found will probably be greatly exaggerated, and no clear idea of
the time of finding can be reached; yet any such detail may be
useful.</p>

<p>Any large town site must have a cemetery, which is near it in
most cases. In Egypt the towns being in the inundated land, the
cemeteries are at some miles distant on the desert. The prehistoric
cemeteries may be anywhere; the historic cemeteries are usually
round the ends of the dyke roads, which were thrown up in the early
dynasties as irrigation dams, and still serve as the roads of the
country. In Greek lands cemeteries are always outside a town,
usually by the side of the roads.</p>

<p>Caves should always be carefully explored; the roof and sides
searched for inscriptions or carvings; rock pockets in the sides
examined; and the floor dug over for potsherds and any small
objects. If there are different strata these should be each removed
separately, and the depth and positions of objects noted.</p>

<h4>4. Methods of Planning.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>Though we cannot here give full technical details of all the
methods for plans and surveys, it will be useful to state the scope
of each method, so that they may be kept in mind, and whichever is
best suited to the individual and his work may be provided for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;1. Plain pacing. After pacing lengths of a few hundred
feet, up and down hill and flat, tape the distances, and learn true
value of pace. Careful pacing can be done to one or two per cent.
of the whole; and properly used, in triangles, may give a useful
plan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;2. Pacing and compass. This covers large spaces quickly,
but the compass is less accurate than the pace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;3. Tape. Lines of taping must be well planned, with
triangle ties to secure the angles. Pulling up straight is
difficult in a wind, especially on broken ground, and one per cent.
error is quite possible then. When working alone peg the tape down
by the ring, or round a stone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;4. Tapes and cross lines. Stretch two strings crossing
squarely on the ground: fix the square by laying a squared drawing
block below and looking at strings over it. Two helpers each hold a
tape, zero on a string, and the two tapes are held together by the
observer and read off, giving the distance to each string; this is
to be plotted at once on squared paper, and the plan is completed
in detail as it progresses, without any note&ndash; book or later
plotting. The helpers must be capable of holding the tape square to
the string. Good for sites up to two hundred or three hundred
feet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;5. Plane table. Excellent for some ground, where objects
are visible from a distance: otherwise it requires a marker put up
at every point to be fixed. Cumbrous to carry, much slower than
4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;6. Box sextant, used as giving angular accuracy to any of
the foregoing; most useful with taping, and in following.</p>

<p>&nbsp;7. Sextant and three points. The most rapid accurate
method is to adopt three points visible all over the ground (as
trees or chimneys) or set up three markers. Find shape and size of
this triangle. Then at any point take two angles visible between
the points, and this fixes position of observer. A large site may
have forty points fixed in two hours thus to about 1 in 1000. For
detail and plotting see Petrie, <em>Methods and Aims in
Archaeology</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;8. Theodolite. For the most accurate work a theodolite is
used, giving points to about 1 in 5000. It is almost essential for
any astronomical meridian or latitude.</p>

<p>None of these methods necessitate any helper, except 4 which
needs two helpers. The observation is from the point to be fixed in
1, 2, 3, 4, and 7; but it is <em>to</em> the point, needing signals
or visible features on the points, in 5, 6, and 8, and for those
methods a large stock of rods must be taken, and the whole ground
gone over, before the work of observation; such methods take far
more time than the others. The able surveyor will know by instinct
how to use all the inferior methods as supplements to the higher,
whenever time demands and accuracy allows.</p>

<p>When first searching a site, note the direction of any wall to
the horizon point, and so see if other walls are parallel.</p>

<p>In all cases a plumb line is wanted for alining foundations and
scattered blocks. Always carry six feet of thin string, and pick up
the nearest suitable stone for a weight, up to three or four pounds
in a wind.</p>

<h4>5. Drawing and Copying.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p><b>Inscriptions.</b> If there is any chance of being interrupted
by any claimant, or by crowds, always make a hand copy at once, as
quickly as possible. After a squeeze or photograph is taken, yet
the hand copy is often of value to explain positions of squeeze
slips or detail of photographs.</p>

<p>If there is no chance of interruption, then a carefully drawn
copy full size should be made. For this a dry squeeze is the ground
work. Lay a sheet of thin paper, such as thin wrapping or plain
paper, on the stone, and press all the letters over with the
fingers, so as to make a sharp bend; a break in the deep hollows
does not matter. Then, putting the paper on a drawing&ndash;board
or sheet of millboard, cock it up so that the shadow of the squeeze
is seen, and draw over the lines (starting at right base),
referring to the stone whenever uncertain. This is the only right
way to copy hieroglyphics by hand. Note that the edges are usually
rather worn, and the drawn lines should be inside the squeeze
lines. If the stone is large, several lesser sheets are best.</p>

<p>Where there is writing, or the relief is too faint to squeeze,
put the paper immediately below the first line, and draw it sign
for sign, so that the spacing is preserved and no omission is
possible. Fold back the paper as each line is copied, and so always
keep the copying close below the line of inscription.</p>

<p>If the signs are in an alphabet that is not familiar, refer to
the table of alphabets.</p>

<p><b>Sculpture</b> Sculpture in low relief can be copied best by
dry squeeze. As the connexion of the sheets used should be exact,
put up the first sheet truly vertical, and mark little pencil
crosses at the corners on the stone. Then the corners of successive
sheets should be fitted into the angles of the crosses. When inking
in the pencil drawings, do not carry the lines within two inches of
the edges of the sheets. Then place sheets edge to edge, adjust
them to fit as best they may, weight them heavily with books, turn
back one edge and weight it, and then slip a strip of wetted
adhesive paper half&ndash;way under the edge that is down; at once
liberate the edge that is up, and dab (not rub) both heavily down
on the adhesive. This makes a joint free of cockling, and when dry
the inking can be completed across the joint. Where there is any
colour remaining on sculpture or inscription, only dry squeezing is
permissible.</p>

<p>Where signs are worn or decayed it is needful to try various
lighting. This can be done in the open air, by shading the part by
the hands placed around it as a sort of tube, the head blocking out
the light over the tube. Then quickly raise a hand alternately, so
as to reverse the oblique lighting, and watch the effect on the
sign.</p>

<p>If the stone has not too tender a face, careful washing often
brings out an inscription; and in such cases it is usually far
easier to copy from a wet than from a dry stone.</p>

<p>If reliefs have been much weathered they can be made plain for
photographing by laying horizontal and covering with sand; on
wiping away the sand from the relief the ground will be left flat
sand, so hiding the confused hollows of weathering.</p>

<p>The safest way for drawings to travel is to post them at the
nearest post direct to where they will be worked up. The Postal
Union takes rolls of 21 cm. thick, 60 cm. long, up to 5 kilos as
parcels, or rolls of 10 cm. thick, 75 cm. long, up to 2 kilos by
book post open at ends. This is far better than carrying rolls by
hand.</p>

<p><b>Wet squeezing.</b> Where there is no colour, and the stone is
strong and not crumbling, a wet squeeze is the best copy. There are
three purposes for it, and the method differs for each; (1) thin
single sheet kept fresh on the outer face for photographing later;
or (2) single sheet well beaten in and patched, depending on
pricking the outlines and hand&ndash;copy from it, or blacking over
the relief on the inner side and photographing; or (3) double sheet
hard beaten, and patched in the hollows, for plaster casting
afterwards.</p>

<p>For (1) there is no need to get an impression of the hollows to
the bottom, and the face of the paper should be smooth. A soft
paper, with little or no size, and a soft clothes&ndash;brush will
do well for this. The sheet should cover the whole inscription, or
have as few joints as may be. The stone should be dabbed with a wet
brush so as to saturate the face, the sheet of paper well soaked in
water laid upon it, taking care not to leave bubbles, and then
dabbing firmly with the brush will drive the paper into the
hollows. If the stone is polished or very smooth, it is needful to
peel off the paper while wet by holding two corners, and lay it
reversed on a flat surface to dry; if left on the stone the
contraction will destroy the impress. Out of doors the paper can be
held down by pebbles around it, or by sand on the edges, to prevent
the wind catching it.</p>

<p>(2) The stronger squeeze should be of a tough paper with
moderate sizing. Cut the paper to the form of the stone. Thrust it
into a pail of water, knead it about vigorously, roll it into a
ball and pummel it, so as to break the grain and let the water well
into it. Then wet the stone, shake out the paper like a wet
handkerchief, full of creases, lay it on the stone and begin to
beat it in with a hard, long spoke&ndash;brush. A few strokes round
the edge will catch it down so that the wind does not disturb it.
Then begin to beat it heavily along the top edge; beat it to a
pulp, and patch with strips left soaking in the water wherever
breaks occur. If the stone is porous the paper may part from it,
especially if expanded by beating; the only course then is to slush
more water on the face so that it will go through the breaks and
hold the paper down again. It may be needful to slit the paper to
let the water go below it. Beat down again, enough to fix it.</p>

<p>(3) For casting purposes a final backing sheet, moderately
beaten on, is needed to hold the squeeze together and stiffen it.
Either (2) or (3) can be left on the face of the stone till quite
dry, and then carefully detached by lifting up from one corner, and
slipping a dinner&ndash;knife or a slip of wood under the paper to
lift any part that sticks.</p>

<p>Stiff squeezes as (3) must be packed flat; thin, as (1) and
sometimes (2), may be rolled in a large curve, but this always
deteriorates a squeeze.</p>

<p>For plaster casting, a squeeze should be heated on a stove and
brushed over with melted paraffin, or better wax, sufficient to
cover the face without choking the finer detail. Before each cast
the face should be lightly oiled with a tuft of wool.</p>

<p><b>Small objects.</b> These can be copied by a thin paper
squeeze, and the squeeze may be mounted by pasting a card and
lightly pressing the squeeze back down on it. This will take out
all cockling and make it lie flat for photographing.</p>

<p>Tin&ndash;foil is very handy for squeezes, and may be saved from
chocolate for this. Press it firmly on a coin or seal with a tuft
of wool, or beat it with a soft tooth&ndash;brush, being careful to
avoid creases. The foil should then be floated on water, hollow
back up, and blazing sealing&ndash;wax dropped into it to back it.
The resulting positive can be then stuck on card.</p>

<p>For plaster casts of coins the face should be dusted with French
chalk, as also a smooth bed of plasticine; the coin can then be
pressed in safely without any possible risk, and afterward plaster
cast in the mould. Sealing&ndash;wax is said to be sharper, but
there is a risk of its sticking to the coin. If it is used, breathe
hard on the coin, or wet it, before impressing; and when first set
lift it slightly to detach it, and then replace till cold. Or
tin&ndash;foil may be used, as in making positives; but, instead of
floating on water, press plasticine on the foil while it is still
on the object.</p>

<p>For curved surfaces, as cylinders, any of these methods can be
used; the plasticine is the more successful.</p>

<p>In all casting of plaster on a small scale, use a soft
camel&ndash;hair brush. Mix the plaster in the palm of the hand
with a knife, take up some of the wettest to brush over the face of
the moulds (a dozen scarabs or small coins done at once); then put
he brush in water, and take up thicker plaster with a
pocket&ndash;knife to drop on as a backing. This avoids air bubbles
without using too weak a plaster.</p>

<p><b>Copying hieroglyphic inscriptions.</b> Where possible a wet
or a dry squeeze should be taken of any inscription. When hand
copying is necessary, the main matter is to get the cartouches of
king's names accurately, and the date at the beginning, examining
specially whether single strokes, <B>I I I I</B>, have been connected
above, <B>&cap;&cap;</B>, forming the ten sign. The main difficulty
for any one
not knowing the 800 signs is to distinguish between those that are
alike, especially when damaged. For this purpose the commonest
signs that may be confused are here placed together, so that the
essential points of difference may be noticed. A small cross is
placed here by small points of distinction which might escape
notice.</p>

<h4>Illustration I: Some Hieroglyphic Signs Liable To Be Confused
With Each Other</h4>

<br>
<br>
<h4>6. Photography.</h4>

<p>The camera and material have been described under outfit.</p>

<p>Lighting and preparation of objects is a main element of
success. When first looking over any ruins, make a list of every
view wanted, with the time of day when the sun will be right for
it. Then follow the time&ndash;table, and so get the best lighting
all in one day.</p>

<p>For movable stones or figures place them in half&ndash;shade, as
a doorway, and then tilt every way until the best lighting is
found, fix them in that position, and then set up the camera square
with them.</p>

<p>The camera should usually be fixed to look downward vertically,
and then variation up to 40 degrees can be got by the legs. Hold
the camera in the right position, keeping the legs off the ground,
and then drop the legs to find their own place; thus very skew
positions can be fixed quickly.</p>

<p>Small objects are best laid on black velvet, and taken
vertically. Scraps of charcoal are useful to prop them in exact
positions. A sheet of white paper stuck on a leg of the stand may
be useful to prevent shadows being too heavy. Where outline, and
not flat detail, is wanted, then a light ground is best; the most
perfect is a sheet of ground glass with white paper a foot or two
below it. If the ground glass cannot be had, a good
substitute&ndash;also useful for a camera glass&ndash;is plain
glass with a sheet of tissue paper (or the packing paper of films)
stuck on with paraffin wax.</p>

<p>The dressing of objects to show up clearly is often needful.
Incised objects can be filled in with charcoal powder if light, or
chalk if dark; in any case a coarse powder, so as not to stain the
object. For faint cutting on glass or crystal go over the lines
with 'China ink in a pen, so as to cover them. Harden the ink in
the sun, and then gently wipe with a damp finger until all the
excess is removed and only the roughness of the lines remains
black. On large objects light dust or sand is often useful, to make
relief clearer.</p>

<p>For objects in a bad light, or in the interior of tombs,
reflected light must be used. Lids of biscuit tins serve well; a
lid in the sun sixty feet off, and another lid reflecting the light
on to a wall, will suffice for a two minutes' exposure of a slow
plate. Three or four successive reflections into a totally dark
chamber will suffice in five or six minutes.</p>

<p>When an important subject cannot be revisited it is well to take
duplicates; the camera should be shifted laterally a few inches for
a near object, or a few feet for a distant view, and then the two
films will form a stereograph, if both succeed.</p>

<p>In arranging groups of small objects, put together what will go
in a three&ndash;inch circle, and minor pieces around, and then the
best in the middle can be printed direct on lantern slides.</p>

<h4>7. Preservation and Packing.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>While travelling little can be done for preserving objects.
Papyrus rolls should be wrapped at once in a damp handkerchief, to
be carried, and then wrapped in paper, packed in a tin box, and
filled round with cotton wool. Small papyri can be safely damped in
a wet cloth, and flattened out between the leaves of a book; secure
one edge straight in the hinge, and gradually press flat and secure
by advancing leaves over it. Glass, if perfect, should be packed in
tins with wool; old food or tobacco tins do well for tender
things.</p>

<p>Flint implements and coins, though hardy, should be saved from
grinding by wrapping in waste paper.</p>

<p>Ivory, if it has been buried, is very liable to flake. The cure
is to soak it in paraffin wax; but temporarily it is secured by
winding cotton thread round it in many directions. Some anoint it
with vaseline, but if vaseline penetrates the ivory, it will not
take up paraffin or gelatine later. Tender wood may be likewise
saved.</p>

<p>A much&ndash;cracked glazed jar was packed by winding string
round it in all directions, with tufts of wool under the
string.</p>

<p>A whole mummy in most fragile condition, so that it could not be
lifted, was made up solid with 40 lb. of paraffin wax which was
melted out of it afterwards in England, making hardly any change.
If contracted burials should be preserved, dust carefully, splash
on about 5 lb. of paraffin wax heated to smoking&ndash;point. When
cold, detach from soil, turn over, paraffin the lower side, and
build up weak parts with a sludge of melted paraffin and sand,
nearly chilled. About 8 to 10 lb. of wax will do the whole. The
skull should be packed separately. Pad all hollows of the body with
soft rag to spread pressure in packing. Paraffin wax is the best
preservative as it is tough, and may be used as a coat over an
object for safety. When not needed it can be cut away, or melted
away, and cleaned off completely with benzol. It should be melted
in an iron saucepan, as solder will give way if it is superheated.
As it melts at about 120 degrees F., and boils at about 600 degrees
F., it can be greatly superheated, and used when smoking, so as to
penetrate deeply into wood or porous material. It is perfect for
strengthening skulls; most rotten examples slopped with paraffin,
and finally soused for a few seconds so as entirely to cover the
bone in and out, will travel safely, if not crushed.</p>

<p><b>Boxes</b> must always have corner posts, inside or out; see
that the sides are nailed up to the edges to the posts, or the lid
or bottom may part by the side splitting. See that all
nails&mdash;except for the lid&mdash;are driven slanting
alternately one way and reversed, this prevents sides or bottom
drawing off. Nail the lid with many short nails, so that it can be
raised without splitting.</p>

<p>To secure heavy objects in a mixed box, an inverted rough stool
is the best, the cross piece on the object below, and the sides
coming up to the lid. If cross bars are nailed in a box, damage may
be done to an object in forcing the bars loose. It is often best to
put heavy and light things in the same box, to equalize weights in
journeying; if well secured, a mixed boxful travels well. Be very
careful that a wedge&ndash;shaped stone cannot force itself loose
by repeated jolts, or it may split a box.</p>

<p>Slabs of stone ire best packed in open shallow boxes face down
on straw or wool, secured by a few diagonal cross bars on the top,
as then they do not need to be opened for customs. All stones of
regular form should be supported at a fifth of the length from each
end. No bedding on a box is worth anything, as the box will bend
more than the stone, and the strain will all come on the middle.
Very heavy blocks are best with sacking on the face, and roped
round in various parts.</p>

<p>Pottery is most difficult to pack safely. For large jars, mark
the points of contact on the box, and nail on cushions of old cloth
stuffed hard with straw, so as to pad the jar on all sides; make
sure that it cannot twist about into a diagonal position off the
pads. Long boxes, five or six feet, with three or four cross
divisions, are best. Begin packing, say four pots with straw, at
one end of the box, press up a cross board tight on them, and nail
through the sides: then another batch likewise; about one inch
thick of hard&ndash;pressed straw is needful at each contact. Twist
straw into rough bands, and wind it round each pot. Fill up corners
to prevent the bands shifting loose. Empty small tins make good
stuffing for blank spaces. Old newspapers torn to bits and rolled
into balls make good packing for pots and hold them firmly, but
this method is dangerous if the packing becomes wetted. Pots should
always be packed tight. Old sacking or cotton stuff may be tied on
over the mouth of large pots, to prevent straw slipping in, and
loosening the packing.</p>

<p>Bronzes and coins should not be cleaned in any way, till in a
settled work place.</p>

<h4>8. Forgeries and. Buying.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>Most travellers wish to buy some things of interest, and in
remote districts they may do good service in rescuing important
objects which may be wanted in museums. Forgeries are ubiquitous,
even in most obscure places in the hands of peasants, either
supplied by dealers, or casually obtained, often in good faith. It
is best to inquire of local collectors and museums as to the kinds
of forgeries met with. The following notes are to show the novice
how far he may go safely.</p>

<p><b>Bronze</b> figures with a thick red patina, which scales off
readily sometimes, or with thick green patina cracked, or hard
green or brown patina, are safe. Thin green patina, or bare brown
or black metal is dubious.</p>

<p><b>Papyri</b> in roll, flexible though fragile, in known Greek
or Egyptian writing, are fairly safe. Lumps stuck together, brown
and scrappy, are made up.</p>

<p><b>Coins</b> cannot be safely bought unless patinated, copper or
silver. Only an expert can judge of gold or 'clean silver.</p>

<p><b>Jewellery</b> of small size, as earrings and bracelets, is
generally safe, if the age of the design is known. Modern wire is
always drawn, ancient is irregular. Look for concretions of lime in
the hollows, and for the dull face of old gold. If once cleaned
there is little to distinguish old from modern gold.</p>

<p><b>Stone vases</b> if turned are Roman or modern. The ancient
irregularities should be studied from specimens.</p>

<p><b>Scarabs</b> with nacreous or decomposed glaze in the hollows
(as in the deep cuts at the side) are safe; also, if there are
natural cracks by age, which would prevent modern cutting. There is
a large variety of skilful forgeries.</p>

<p><b>Stone statuettes:</b> a skilled forger may be paid up to
&pound;100
for a figure to order. Only an expert can judge.</p>

<p>Never buy in the dusk or in dark rooms. When buying never have
any one at hand who calls attention to things, nor let any
attendant interfere. Seem entirely unconcerned.</p>

<p>Get the reputation of never advancing on offers, or bargaining;
let taking or leaving things at once be the rule. Time and delays
are money to the traveller, and it is worth much to save time in
haggling. Your donkey&ndash;boy will soon spread your
character.</p>

<p>When offering for single things to a peasant, put the money by
the side of the antiquity, and say that he must take one or the
other: fingering the cash is irresistible, and no time is lost.</p>

<p>If it is likely that the source of an object will not be truly
stated, the way is to make the best guess you can, and say it
dogmatically: the pleasure of setting you right will often bring
out the truth, or if you guessed right it will gain you credit and
break down reserve.</p>

<p>As a principle it is well to be looked on as a liberal buyer, so
as to encourage the offer of antiquities. A little more thus spent
will be a trifling extra on the whole journey, and may largely
increase the results in objects and information for future
work.</p>

<p>Though prices can only be learned by practice, and they vary in
time and place, yet the following scale may be taken as fairly
safe.</p>

<p>Bronze figures if good work, inches high squared = shillings:
except in bad state, or Osiris, or bad clumsy work, or votive
animals.</p>

<p>Papyri or parchment, continuous text, &pound;1 a square foot,
accounts, half or a third.</p>

<p>Jewellery, between weight in coin and double that, according to
work.</p>

<p>Scarabs, common but fair 2s., names 2s.&ndash;5s.; up to &pound;5
or &pound;10 if beautiful. Engraved gems, small common
Roman, 2s.&ndash;4s. in London, more in East; for a fair Greek
&pound;1&ndash;&pound;10.</p>

<p>Coins often higher in the East than in London. In Greek lands
copper coins may be bought by weight, and picked over at leisure,
and the worthless coins rejected. For single coins fix a price, say
half a franc, and offers of large numbers may come in, from which
the best can be chosen and the rest refused.</p>

<p>Glass vases, blown, inches high squared at 4d. or 6d. each.
Coloured glass double or triple.</p>

<p>Ushabtis, poor 1s.&ndash;4s., fair 5s.&ndash;10s., fine blue or
engraved &pound;1&ndash; &pound;10.</p>

<h2><a name="intro-2">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</a></h2>

<br>
<br>


<p>The aim of the special sections contained in Chapters
III&ndash;VIII is to describe, not the objects usually to be seen
in Museums, but only such things as will be found lying out on
mounds and sites, and as are more or less distinctive of a period.
Thus certain comparatively trivial objects are named, because they
are peculiar to a period, and likely to be found in a casual
passage over a site, whereas other objects, common to several
periods, are ignored. Only the distinctive, key objects are
mentioned. The great features of Greek Art, for instance, are not
dealt with in Chapter II; nor are coins, the probabilities of
finding them being too slender, and the possibilities too wide.
Nevertheless, coins when found should be carefully quoted. Pottery
naturally takes the largest place, as it was abundant, and its
fragments are a good guide to period, and being practically
indestructible and of no intrinsic value are most likely to be met
with. The difference between pottery made with the use of the wheel
and that made without is important to be noted. The use of the
wheel can usually be detected through the slight inequalities of
the clay that make a series of parallel lines on the inner surface.
The diagrammatic representations of the pot&ndash;forms
characteristic of various periods or of other objects ranging
through a civilization the main features of which can be shown in
outline will, it is hoped, be found useful. Simplified tables of
alphabets, intended to make it possible roughly to identify the
script, if not the date, of an inscription, are also given.</p>

<h4>Illustration II: Flint Implements</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>As the development of Flint Implements follows more or less the
same course in all the districts with which this volume deals, a
general description is given here, to avoid repetition in the
special sections.</p>

<p>The earlier periods of man are so remote that geological
changes, wet, and decay, have removed nearly all his works except
the flint tools. It is to these chiefly that we must look for our
knowledge of his abilities. Flints are nearly all that we have for
the early stages, to supply what arts, history, and literature give
in later stages. To preserve and educe all we possibly can obtain
from their situation, and purpose, is a main duty to history. To
destroy or confuse the evidence, by removing specimens without a
record, or by shifting them to a different place, is a crime in
science. As there is no temptation to ignorant peasants to move
flints until they are induced by collectors, so the whole fault of
the wreckage that has taken place in many sites lies on the
plundering collector. No money or reward should be given for any
flints; a few fine specimens may be lost, but vastly more harm
would be done by encouraging mere raiding.</p>

<p>The periods and styles that are now recognized are shown on the
diagram&mdash;and their conditions were:</p>

<p>The information required of all observers is the level and
conditions of all flint tools that they may see or collect.</p>

<p><b>Gravels</b> containing tools may be surface gravels on a
plateau; note then the level, and the relation of them to any
cliffs; do they end abruptly at a cliff edge, showing that the
valley was filled up; or do they fade away to the edge, showing
that they are older than the valley erosion? Gravels may be the
filling up of a valley which was previously eroded; note the
highest level at which they can be traced; often little pockets of
deposit, or traces of sandy strata, can be found clinging high up
on cliffs; also note the depths in the gravel at which any tools
are found. Any shells or bones in the gravels are of the greatest
value; the depth at which they are found should be written on them
at once, with the locality.</p>

<p><b>Surface flints</b> should have levels noted on them. If sharp
they show that probably submergence has not reached that level
since; if worn, then water has been up to a higher level, from
which they have been washed down.</p>

<p><b>Levelling</b> may be read from a contour map, if there is
such available. In most countries it must be done by reading feet
on an aneroid barometer, set with zero of level scale to 30 ins. or
760 mm. Then visit as soon as possible some point where a level is
marked on the map, as a hill top, and read the barometer. This will
give the correction to be made to all the previous notes. If there
is no level recorded, get down to a stream bed (the larger the
better) and read it there, recording the exact place on the map.
The level may then be worked out approximately by points above and
below on the stream, for accurate reading, hold the aneroid face
up, gently tap it, and read; then face down similarly, and take the
mean. Guard that the wind does not blow against any keyhole in the
case.</p>

<p>Pencil all levels and localities on flints as soon as found. Ink
in the notes on the least prominent parts of the flint, in small
capital letters, when in camp, with waterproof China ink.</p>

<p><b>Styles of flint work.</b> The Eoliths are worn pebbles,
chipped as if for scraping. The Rostro&ndash; carinate flints found
at the base of the Crag are long bars with a beak&ndash;end, suited
for breaking up earth. The human origin of both of these classes is
contested. Flints of Strepy type are nodular and partly trimmed
into cutting edges, the smooth surface being left as a handle. The
Chelles types are remarkable for regularity and fine bold flaking;
the worn butt (though best for handling) was eventually flaked away
to obtain an artistic uniform finish. The St. Acheul series has
finer flaking, the crust being completely removed: there is a
tendency to ovate or almond shapes, and the edges are often curved,
the reverse S&ndash;curve being preferred, They diminish in size
towards the end of the period. The Chelles and St. Acheul series
are core implements, made by detaching flakes; and the succeeding
(Le Moustier) method is to use the flakes, generally for scraping.
The LA, EM the diagram is transitional from St. Acheul to Le
Moustier. The form marked M is the predecessor of the Solutrean
form next below it. The Aurignacian is a smaller flake industry,
with many lumps more or less conical, and often with careful
parallel flaking or fluting. The Solutre culture brought in a new
style, particularly thin blades with delicate surface flaking which
seems to have reappeared in the late Neolithic. The pointed borers,
certain arrow&ndash;heads and minutely chipped rods of flint are
characteristic of the period, and flints of this age are found on
the Egyptian and Syrian deserts. Longer blades, sometimes very
coarse, with ends worn by scraping, mark the period of La
Madeleine. They are found in prehistoric Egyptian graves, along
with Neolithic knives and lances. As a technical advance on flaking
by blows or pressure, grinding and incidental polishing of flint
implements are regarded as characteristic of the Neolithic period;
and the practice may have started in areas devoid of flint, where
it was necessary to utilize local material that could not be flaked
like flint. In Europe generally, polished celts belong to the
Megalithic or latest division of the Neolithic, but this implement
appeared much earlier, and in a sense succeeded the Palaeolithic
hand&ndash;axe. The latter is not known to have been hafted, and
its working edges were at the pointed end; whereas in Neolithic
times the implement had become an axe in the modern sense, with the
pointed end inserted in a haft, and the cutting edge removed to the
broader end. There are many other Neolithic types, used with or
without a haft, and only a small proportion were finished by
grinding on sandstone.</p>

<p>N<small>EOLITHIC</small>.&mdash;Neolithic settlements on low
mounds (<em>maghoules</em>) rising from the plains.</p>

<p><b>Stone implements.</b> Axes, hammers, chisels, querns, &amp;c.
Flint chips, bone needles, obsidian.</p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b> Hand&ndash;made burnished, yellow, brown, black
or red. Handles rare. Holes in rim, or lugs pierced for suspension,
Earliest remains show painted sherds. Long period of unpainted ware
followed. Patterns irregular, rectangular and curved. No
naturalism. (<a href="#ill3">III,</a> Figs. 1 and 2.)</p>

<p>Ware differs slightly with locality. In Thessaly fine red ware
undecorated contemporary with red decoration on white. Chocolate
paint on deep buff follows. Incised ware, geometric patterns white
rubbed in.</p>

<p><b>Figurines.</b> Rude clay. Steatopygous.</p>

<p>This civilization extended from northern edge of Thessaly as far
south as Chaeronea. Use of bronze before end uncertain.
Civilization undisturbed by Aegean culture that spread over
southern Greece until just before both were swept away by
iron&ndash;using people.</p>

Brown lustrous paint, fine surface to clay. Decoration
naturalistic, flowers, cuttle&ndash;fish, shells, spirals, ripple
patterns, white and orange dots and bands occasionally
super&ndash;imposed on dark glaze (<a href="#ill3">III,</a> Figs. 7,

<p>Marble figurines 'fiddle&ndash;shaped' from Naxos and Paros
(<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 6).</p>

<p><em>Contemporary with Middle Minoan</em></p>

<p>Pottery with very pale sometimes greenish clay, and grey black

<p>Cretan influence strong in Middle Minoan completely drowned
local efforts in first Late Minoan days. Thenceforward local ware
imitative.</p>

<h3><em>SOUTH GREECE.</em></h3>

<br>
<br>


<p>N<small>EOLITHIC</small>. Nothing known.</p>

<p>B<small>RONZE</small> A<small>GE</small>. <b>Geometric Ware</b>
with matt paint and pale clay corresponding to that of islands
found in Argolid and Boeotia.</p>

<p><b>'Urfirnis' Ware.</b> Hand&ndash;made. Whole vase covered with
thin semi&ndash; lustrous wash varying from red&ndash;brown to
black. Sometimes mere smears. Mainly found in Boeotia, but extends
north to valley of Spercheius and south to Argolid. Date uncertain,
but in Boeotia evidence that it ended before rise of 'Minyan'
ware.</p>

<p><b>'Minyan Ware.'</b> Grey unpainted pottery, polished. No
decoration except (rarely) incised lines. Usually wheel&ndash;made.
Characteristic shapes: Goblet with tall ringed stem (<a

<p>Appears to range Between Middle Minoan II and Late Minoan
III.</p>

<p>Most frequent in Boeotia to which it owes its name. Found as far
north as Thessaly and as far south as Crete. Local imitations,
obvious but distinct, found with imported specimens (Melos).
Provenance unknown; connexion with Troy suspected.</p>

<p><b>'Mycenaean.'</b> The Cretan civilization swept over South
Greece in the first Late Minoan period. Characterized by exuberance
both in shape and ornament (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Figs. 11, 12,
13, 16, 17). Bulk of
what is likely to be found is of latest period when style has

<p><b>Seal Stones.</b> Round or bean&ndash;shaped, pierced for
suspension, usually soft stone, e.g. slate or steatite. Sometimes
hard, as hematite or rock crystal. Carved with naturalistic
designs: lions, (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 8), stags, bulls, cows
or hinds suckling
their young, cuttle&ndash;fish, dolphins, &amp;c. Two animals
ranged like heraldic supporters characteristic.</p>

<p><b>Obsidian.</b> Natural glass, volcanic, black. Source Melos.
Used for knives throughout Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Chips of Knife or razor blades, and sometimes the cores from
which these were flaked, may be picked up on any Bronze Age site,
and even on Thessalian neolithic settlements. Glistening black
unmistakable.</p>

<p><b>Terra&ndash;cotta lamps.</b> The characteristic lamp of the
Aegean civilization is open, as opposed to the Greek and Roman lamp
where the body is partly covered in.</p>

<p><b>Walls.</b> Cyclopean walls of huge irregular stones. Also
good square&ndash;cut masonry.</p>

<p>'Corbelling' system for arches, each layer of stones projecting
inwards over the one below. Also used for the vaults of 'Beehive'
Tombs towards end of period.</p>

<h3>II. PREHISTORIC GREEK</h3>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class= "centclass"><em>Geometric or Dipylon Period.</em></p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b><br>
 Iron Age. <em>circ.</em> 1000 B.C.&mdash;Absolute break in
continuity from what preceded. No naturalism. Prevalence of
geometric patterns (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Figs. 18 and 19). Not
much variety.
Meanders, lozenges, and zigzags. Circles joined by tangents replace
Mycenaean spirals. Ornament crowded. Rows or single specimens of
long&ndash;legged water birds. Human figures rare, rude angular
silhouettes.</p>

<p>Local characteristics discernible (e.g. between ware of
Thessaly, Attica, Boeotia, Delphi, Argolid, Laconia, Thera, and
Crete), but strong family resemblance. (Lower specimen <a
href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 19
characteristic of Boeotia.) Dark paint on natural clay (sometimes
lightened by a white slip, e. g. Laconia) differs distinctly from
Mycenaean. Shapes fewer and curves less flowing. Amphorae, plates,
bowls, and jugs. Trefoil lip to jug first appears.</p>

<p>Terra&ndash;cotta loom weights from now onwards often pyramidal
in form and glazed.</p>

<p><b>Bronzes.</b><br>
 <em>Figurines.</em> Three types:&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human, rare (as on vases).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quadrupeds, mainly horses. Cylindrical muzzle
and narrow cylindrical belly (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 23).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds. Long neck and legs, flat bill and body.
Stands to above, flat, square or round, with open&ndash;work snake
or spiral.</p>

<p><em>Pins</em> (to fasten dress at shoulder). Long head with
small bosses like strung beads sometimes separated by discs (<a
href="#ill3">III</a>,
Fig 21). Sometimes larger flat disc at end of head (often missing)
Pin itself usually iron, rarely extant.</p>

<p><em>Brooches.</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Spiral type. Of wire
coiled into spirals. Made of one, two, or three wires crossing with
two, four, or six spirals respectively. Boss at centre. Spectacle
type (two spirals) common. In 'spectacle' type (sometimes very
large) spiral purely utilitarian, giving spring to the pin. With
four or more spirals the additions are ornament, noteworthy in view
of absence of spirals on pottery.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Bow type.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) High arched bow
solid.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Arched bow hollowed like boat inverted. This
type often has flat plate attached to one end, lower edge of which
is bent to form catch. Plate incised, crossed leaves, ships,
horses, or men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Arched bow consisting of
crescent&ndash;shaped plate, similar incised decoration.</p>

<p><b>Paste Beads.</b><br>
A type pyramidal, dark with yellow spirals round corners, much
resembling 'bull's eye' sweets, was common in Laconia (<a
href="#ill3">III</a>,
Fig.27).</p>

<p><b>Terra&ndash;cotta Figurines.</b><br>
Series of rude horses sometimes with riders characteristic of end
of period. Chiefly from Boeotia. Painted like pottery, but chiefly
in lines.</p>

<h3>III. ARCHAIC GREEK</h3>

<br>
<br>


<p>A. <em>Orientalising.</em></p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b><br>
700 B.C.&mdash;Influence from Asia Minor. Recrudescence there of
spirit of Mycenaean art? Lions, stags, sphinxes, sirens, either in
procession or arranged in pairs like heraldic supporters.</p>

<p>Stylized plant motifs in decoration. Rays (or flower petals)
rising from foot most characteristic (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Figs.
24, 26, and
28).</p>

<p>Use of purple paint to supplement black both for details of
figures and for band decoration.</p>

<p>Geometric ornament (though perhaps with a difference) survives
to fill blank spaces on backgrounds of scenes.</p>

<p>Varieties of style. Beasts drawn in silhouette, heads outlined,
eyes, &amp;c., drawn in, early, and mainly in the islands (<a
href="#ill3">III</a>,
Fig. 29). Later whole figures in silhouette with details incised,
particularly identified with Corinthian and Boeotian and Laconian
styles (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 26). Styles most likely to be
found on the
mainland are 'Proto&ndash; Corinthian' and 'Corinthian'.</p>

<p>'Proto&ndash;Corinthian' (also called Argive Linear). Small
vases, very fine pale clay. Decoration chiefly horizontal lines
very fine. Rays from feet. Sometimes silhouette animals round
shoulder.</p>

<p>Characteristic shapes: pear&ndash;shaped aryballoi, and lekythi
with conical body, long neck, and trefoil lip (<a
href="#ill3">III</a>, Figs. 24 and
25).</p>

<p>'Corinthian'. Clay pale buff to warm biscuit colour. Rays round
foot. Purple bands. Rows of usual animals. Incisions. Details in
purple. Ground ornaments, incised rosettes more or less carefully
drawn. These in great profusion leaving very little bare space.
(<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 26; hatched lines=purple.) Throughout
this period desire
for a light ground was felt, and where the natural colour of the
clay did not give sufficient contrast it was covered with a strip
of cream&ndash;or white clay (e.g. Rhodian, Naucratite, Laconian;
see <a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 28, Early Laconian Vase).</p>

<p><b>Terra&ndash;cotta Figurines.</b><br>
Series that culminates with Tanagra figures of fourth century
begins. May be said always to be a step in advance of contemporary
sculpture if any.</p>

<p>Statuettes rare at this date, but relief heads on flat plaques
or on vase handles common. Treatment of hair usually resembles
Restoration wig (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 20). Rosette frequent
on shoulders
represents head of bronze (rarely silver or gold) shoulder pin.</p>

<p><b>Bronzes.</b><br>
<em>Pins</em> (to fasten dress at shoulder). Three large bosses
increasing in size as they near head replace many small equal
bosses of preceding period. Disc heavier (<a href="#ill3">III</a>,
Fig. 22).</p>

<p><em>Brooches</em> Spiral type has disappeared. Couchant lion
type with snake tail has been found at Olympia and Sparta. In
general brooches cease to be common.</p>

<p><em>Plaques</em> (doubtless affixed to wood). Relief patterns of
guilloches or rows of bosses. Figure scenes similar to those on
pottery. Characteristic of seventh century. Chance of picking up
slight.</p>

<p><em>Inscriptions</em> Earliest extant examples of use of Greek
script on stone may date from this period. For developments, see
tables of alphabets, <a href="#ill4">Illustration IV</a>.</p>

<h4>Illustration IV: Greek Alphabets</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>B. <em>Black Figured Period.</em></p>

<p>600 B.C.&mdash;Predominance of Attic pottery. Decay of local
styles. Introduction of red colouring into clay and of superlative
Attic black glaze.</p>

<p>Figure scenes (battle scenes and scenes from mythology) largely
predominate. Black silhouettes, details marked with fine incisions,
additions of purple and white (latter for linen and flesh of
women). Elaborate palmettos characteristic (<a href="#ill3">III</a>,
Fig. 31).</p>

<h3>IV. CLASSICAL GREEK</h3>

<br>
<br>


<p><em>Red Figured Period.</em><br>
525 B.C. Same clay and glaze, but whole vase covered with glaze and
figures reserved showing in colour of clay, details being added
with fine&ndash;drawn lines of glaze.</p>

<p><em>White Attic Vases.</em> The older style of figures drawn in
outline on a light ground (e. g. Naucratite and Rhodian ware), the
space within outlines being filled more or less with wash of
colour, survived in Athens side by side with the more usual black
glazed ware, and in the fifth century was particularly affected for
the class of funerary lekythi, vases made for offering at a tomb
(<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 30). Outlines at first drawn in black,
then golden
brown, lastly a dull red.</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous.</b><br>
<em>Walls</em> Sixth century. Characteristic type of polygonal
wall, each irregular stone very carefully fitted to its
neighbours.</p>

<p><b>Fortifications</b> usually built with square towers and
bastions projecting from the curtain.</p>

<p>Round watch towers here and there to be met with.</p>

<p><em>Bricks</em> . Baked bricks rarely used till Roman days.
Bricks stamped by King Nabis (early second century) have been found
at Sparta.</p>

<p><em>Terra&ndash;cotta roof tiles</em> (sometimes with stamped
inscriptions) largely used.</p>

<p><em>Laconian Pottery Characteristics</em> . Fragments of black
glazed Attic ware are the class of remains easiest to pick up on
any Greek inhabited site, except perhaps in Laconia, where perhaps
for political reasons the local style was never ousted and pursued
its natural process of decay until Hellenistic times. Use of white
slip over pink clay complete at end of seventh century, then
partial; abandoned by beginning of fifth century. Characteristic
patterns, squares, and dots (<a href="#ill3">III</a>, Fig. 28)
seventh century; lotus
and pomegranates sixth century and fifth century.</p>

<p>500 B.C.&mdash;After the end of the fifth century, manufacture
of vases at Athens decayed. Supply chiefly from South Italy.
Growing use of additional white (rare in Attic red figure vases),
sometimes addition of detail in yellowish brown, and a general
coarseness of execution, mark the change.</p>

<p>Terra&ndash;cotta figurines (figures of everyday life, mostly
female; head&ndash;quarters Tanagra in Boeotia) prevalent.</p>

<h3>V. HELLENISTIC</h3>

<br>
<br>


<p>300 B.C. Side by side with decay of red&ndash;figure style
appear two classes of vase that became very prevalent.<br>
(1) White designs, often floral, on totally black ground of
inferior dull glaze.<br>
(2) Black ware decorated not by paint but by moulded figures and
patterns. Also the handles of unpainted jars with stamped
impressions (buff clay) not uncommon. Provenance mainly Rhodes.</p>

<h3>VI. ROMAN</h3>

<br>
<br>


<p>Hellenistic ware (2) is forerunner of Samian or Aretine red
pottery with moulded designs. Very widespread in Greece in Imperial
days.</p>

<h3>VII. BYZANTINE AGE</h3>

<br>
<br>


<p>Remains as far as the scope of this section is concerned are
few. Fragments of pottery may be found at Sparta. These bear strong
resemblance to the contemporary wares found in Egypt belonging to
the early Mohammedan period.</p>

<p>Transparent lustrous glaze. Ground usually pale yellow or cream,
sometimes pale green. Designs childish in character. Lions, birds,
human figures painted in brown under the glaze or incised
through.</p>

<h4>1. Introductory.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>Travellers are more likely to make new discoveries elsewhere
than on the actual sites of ancient towns and villages. In many
cases the site is found to be entirely bare of all remains except
sometimes small fragments of pottery. In general, inscribed and
other stones have been carried away to serve as building material
for mosques, houses, fountains, bridges, &amp;c., or as headstones
for graves in cemeteries or for other utilitarian purposes. It is,
therefore, in and near modern villages and towns that inscriptions
are chiefly to be found, as well as smaller antiquities, such as
clay tablets, pots or fragments of them, terra&ndash;cotta figures,
coins, and so forth. The smaller articles may sometimes be found in
the bazaars, but they are usually in the hands of individuals.</p>

<p>It should not be assumed that inscriptions which are exposed to
public view have all been copied; moreover, new stones are
constantly being turned up, especially where building is going on
and where there are old sites or cemeteries close at hand. Great
numbers of inscribed stones are hidden away in private dwellings,
where they are difficult of discovery and of access. Travellers
should take advantage of opportunities that may offer of examining
antiquities in private houses, and of visiting sites or monuments
about which information may be received, particularly if they are a
little off the beaten track. Reward will often come in the shape of
valuable discoveries, of which many remain to be made. Cilicia in
particular has been imperfectly explored, and interesting monuments
and inscriptions, particularly Hittite, may be found there.</p>

<h4>Illustration V: Asia Minor Pottery</h4>

<br>
<br>


<h4>2. Pottery Fabrics.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>It is not yet possible to describe fully or accurately the
succession of styles, or even to assign all known fabrics to their
proper periods. For this reason, even the most fragmentary
specimens are of interest, provided only that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the outer surface is fairly well
preserved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the place of discovery is known.</p>

<p>All fragments showing a rim or spout, handles or part of a base,
should be preserved until they can be compared with a more perfect
specimen.</p>

<p>The following fabrics, however, are widely distributed, and
usually seem to have flourished in the order in which they are here
described:</p>

<p>A. Hand&ndash;made wares, rough within, but smooth or burnished
surface, self&ndash;coloured (drab or brown), or intentionally
coloured black (by charred matter in the clay, or by a smoky fire),
or red (by a clear fire, sometimes aided by a wash or 'slip' of
more ferruginous clay). Sometimes a black ware is 'overfired' to an
ashy grey.</p>

<p>In such wares ornament is rare, and consists mainly of (a)
incised dots, dashes, or lines, in simple rectilinear patterns
(chevrons, zigzags, lozenges), often enhanced by a white chalky
filling (<a href="#ill5">V</a>, Figs 5&ndash;8); (b) ridges or bosses
modelled in the
clay surface, or adhering to it. The forms are plump and globular,
often round&ndash;bottomed or standing on short feet. Rims are
absent or ill&ndash;developed; necks actually prolonged into
trough&ndash;spouts or long beaks; handles are very simple and
short. Vases are sometimes modelled like animals, or have human
faces or breasts (<a href="#ill5">V</a>, Figs. 1&ndash;4).</p>

<p>These wares begin in the Stone Age, and seem to predominate in
the early and middle Bronze Age. Locally they may have lasted even
later, but the use of the potter's wheel spread rapidly in the
early Bronze Age.</p>

<p>B. Hand&ndash;made wares of light&ndash;coloured clay, with
painted decoration, usually in black or reddish&ndash;brown. The
paint is generally without glaze, but sometimes is decayed and
easily washes off.</p>

<p>The forms and ornaments resemble those of class A, but are less
rude and more varied. Distinct rims and standing&ndash;bases
appear, and spouts give place to a pinched lip.</p>

<p>C. Hand&ndash;made wares of black or other dark clay, with
painted decoration in white or ochre. These fabrics are rather
rare, and the paint is easily washed off. The forms follow those of
class B.</p>

<p>Classes B and C seem to begin early in the Bronze Age, and are
gradually replaced by the corresponding wheel&ndash;made fabrics of
class D.</p>

<p>D. Wheel&ndash;made pottery begins in the Bronze Age, and is
distinguished by its symmetrical forms, and by the texture of the
inner surface, especially about the rim and base, where the
potter's fingers have grazed the whirling clay. Self&ndash;coloured
wares still occur, and are sometimes elegant ('bucchero' ware); but
the improved furnaces now permit general use of
light&ndash;coloured clays, suited to painted decoration. Glazed
paint is still rare, and may be taken as probable token of date not
earlier than the end of the Bronze Age. The glaze&ndash; painted
wares of the Greek island&ndash;world occasionally wandered to the
mainland a little earlier than this, but not far from the coast. On
wheel&ndash;made pottery the ornament is either (a) applied while
the pot is on the wheel, and consequently limited to lines and
bands following the plane of rotation, or (b) added afterwards,
free&ndash;hand, usually between such bands, and especially on the
neck and shoulder.</p>

<p>Simple rectilinear schemes are commonest (panels, lozenges, and
triangles, enriched with lattice and chequers) (<a
href="#ill5">V</a>, Figs. 9, 10, 11,
12); with these in the Early Iron Age appear little targets of
concentric circles drawn mechanically with compasses (<a
href="#ill5">V</a>, Figs.
13&ndash;15); also, by degrees, birds (<a href="#ill5">V</a>, Fig.
16), animals, and
simple plant designs (rosettes, lotus, palmette), and occasionally
human figures. But as a rule, the mainland pottery is very simply
decorated, and insular imports are rare, except within the area
within Greek colonization.</p>

<p>In the Later Iron Age or Historic Period, from the seventh
century onward, the pot&ndash;fabrics of Asia Minor rapidly
assimilate two main classes of foreign fashions, Greek and
Oriental.</p>

<p>E. The Oriental types (mainly from Syria) are all plump and
heavy looking, usually in coarse buff or cream&ndash;coloured ware,
almost without paint. The Greek forms are more graceful, varied,
and specialized; light&ndash;coloured clays predominate, with
simple bands of black ill&ndash;glazed paint, absorbed by the
inferior clays.</p>

<p>After Alexander's time the Greek and the Oriental forms became
confused; the general level of style and execution falls, painted
decoration almost disappears, and the outer surface is often ribbed
by uneven pressure of the fingers on the whirling clay. This
fashion is a sign of late Hellenistic or Graeco&ndash;Roman
date.</p>

<p>F. Meanwhile, the black&ndash;glazed Greek (mainly Athenian)
wares spread widely for table use, and were imitated locally from
the fourth century onwards. The clay is pale or reddish (genuine
Greek fabrics are usually quite red within) and the glaze thick,
black, and of a brilliant glassy smoothness. Imitations are of all
degrees of inferiority.</p>

<p>G. Other late fabrics have smooth ill&ndash;glazed surfaces, of
various red, brown, or chocolate tints, over hard&ndash;baked
dull&ndash;fractured paste not unlike modern earthenware, but
usually dark&ndash;coloured. These wares begin in the Hellenistic
period, and go on into the Roman and early Byzantine Ages. They
have sometimes a little ornament in a hard white or cream 'slip'
which stands up above the surface of the vase. These fabrics are
all for table use, or for tomb&ndash;furniture, and are usually of
small size.</p>

<p>H. Pottery with vitreous glaze like modern earthenware only
appears on Byzantine and Turkish sites. There a few late Greek and
Roman fabrics of glazed ware, mostly of dark brown and
olive&ndash;green tints; but they are rare, and usually found in
tombs. The earlier glazes are applied directly to the clay; later a
white or coloured slip is applied first, and a clear siliceous
glaze over this.</p>

<h4>3. Inscriptions and Monuments.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>A. <em>Hittite Civilization.</em> (See figures, <a
href="#ill6">Illustration VI</a>:
Hittite Inscriptions, etc.)</p>

<p>(1) From 2000 B.C. onwards baked clay tablets with cuneiform (or
wedge&ndash;shaped) writing (<a href="#ill6">Illustration VI</a>,
Fig. 1) to be found
anywhere in Eastern Asia Minor, within the Halys bend and south of
it, in Southern Cappadocia, in Cilicia, and in North Syria up to
the Euphrates.</p>

<p>(2) 1000&ndash;700 B.C. probably: inscriptions generally cut on
stone, dark and hard (black basalt), or on the living rock, in
hieroglyphic writing. The hieroglyphs are either cut in relief (<a
href="#ill6">VI</a>,
Fig. 4) or incised (<a href="#ill6">VI</a>, Fig. 2). Found in the
same region and
sporadically west of the Halys.</p>

<p>(3) From 1400 B.C. and 900 B.C. onwards monuments and sculpture.
Human figures are short and thick, generally wearing boots with
toes turned up (<a href="#ill6">VI</a>, Fig. 3.) Found in the same
regions as the
inscriptions and also west of the Halys to the sea.</p>


<p>B. <em>Lydian inscriptions.</em></p>

<p>From about 500 B.C. Letters mostly like Greek capitals
(sometimes reversed); (<a href="#ill4">Illustration IV</a>, at
bottom).</p>

<p>C. <em>Lycian inscriptions and monuments</em></p>

<p>From about 500 B.C. inscriptions, sometimes with a Greek
translation. (<a href="#ill4">IV</a>, at bottom.)</p>

<p>Monuments, mostly with inscriptions, are generally tombs in
stone, built to imitate wood, with the ends of beams projecting or
showing.</p>

<p>D. <em>Greek antiquities.</em></p>

<p>(1) Early period to 323 B.C. the great Greek colonies on the
seaboard and in the coast valleys really formed an outlying part of
Greece, and for them the section on Greece should be consulted.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Periods of Seleucid and Pergamene</em> rule,
323&ndash;130 B.C. Inscriptions of these periods to be found mostly
in the coastal region, rarely on the plateau. Chiefly royal
ordinances, thank offerings, municipal honorary inscriptions,
decrees, covenants, and the like.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Graeco&ndash;Roman period</em>, 130 B.C.&ndash;A.D.
400. Language of inscriptions remains normally Greek, though the
lettering gradually assumes a different character from century to
century, steadily deteriorating. The Phrygian language, written in
Greek letters, survives for several centuries in epitaphs, part of
the inscription often being in Greek.</p>

<p>Latin inscriptions are not common except in Roman colonies
during the earlier centuries of their existence. Elsewhere they are
chiefly official documents of various kinds (e.g. imperial
ordinances, milestones usually of columnar shape with the Emperor's
titles, boundary stones, &amp;c.), or expressions of homage to
Emperors, honorary inscriptions to governors and other officials,
dedications, epitaphs, &amp;c. Sometimes a Greek version is
added.</p>

<p>Latin inscriptions of the Republican period (recording decrees
of the Senate) are extremely rare.</p>

<h3>CYPRUS</h3>

<br>
<br>
 <br>


<p>[The traveller will find the <em>Catalogue of the Cyprus
Museum</em> , by J. L. Myres and M. Ohnefalsch&ndash;Richter
(Oxford, 1899) indispensable for the study of Cypriote Antiquities.
Reference may also be made to Myres, <em>Catalogue of the Cesnola
Collection of Antiquities from Cyprus</em> (New York, 1914). They
contain numerous illustrations of types, and make diagrams for the
present section unnecessary.]</p>

<p>The principal classes of ancient remains are as follows:</p>

<p><b>Settlements.</b> These are usually much devastated by the
removal of building materials to more recent habitations; or are
obscured by modern towns and villages on the same site. All
foundations in squared masonry, or composed of unusually large
stones, should be noted and protected as far as possible. The
frequent presence of large building stones, and especially of
architectural fragments, in recent house&ndash;walls probably
indicates the neighbourhood of an ancient building: and all
reconstructions and fresh foundation&ndash;trenches should be kept
under observation. The present Antiquity Law provides for the
inspection and custody of ancient remains so exposed: the Curator
of Ancient Monuments is charged with the supervision of all
buildings and monuments above ground; the Keeper of Antiquities for
the custody of movable objects, and for the registration of those
already in private possession. Taking into consideration the
utility of good building material to the present owners of such
sites, active co&ndash;operation to preserve ancient masonry is not
to be expected, unless local patriotism and expectation of traffic
from tourists can be enlisted in support of Government regulations.
Architectural fragments found in reconstruction are often best
preserved by arranging that they shall be built conspicuously into
one of the new walls, well above ground&ndash;level, or transferred
to the nearest church or school&ndash;house.</p>

<p><b>Sanctuaries</b> usually consist of a walled enclosure
containing numerous pedestals and bases of votive statues and other
monuments. Usually only the foundation&ndash;walls are of stone, as
the same sun&ndash;dried brick was commonly used in ancient as in
modern times for the superstructure. Such sites are often vary
shallow, and when they occur in the open country are liable to be
disturbed by ploughing, when the smaller statuettes and
terra&ndash;cotta figures may be turned up in considerable numbers.
As most of our knowledge of the sculpture, as well as of the
religious observances, of ancient Cyprus is derived from such
sites, all such indications should be reported at once to the
Keeper of Antiquities, and arrangements made for the site to be
examined with a view to excavation before it is cultivated further.
The sculpture on these sites begins usually in the seventh century
B.C.; before that period terra&ndash;cotta figures were in use as
far back as the ninth or tenth century. Figures of 'Mixed Oriental'
style, resembling Assyrian or Egyptian work, give place about 500
B.C. to a provincial Greek style, which passes gradually into
Hellenistic and Graeco&ndash;Roman. The material is almost
invariably the soft local limestone, and the workmanship is often
clumsy; but even the coarser examples should be treated carefully,
as they were sometimes completed in colours which are easily
destroyed by too vigorous washing. The first cleaning should be
with gently running water only.</p>

<p><b>Tombs</b> are of all periods, and are found not only around
historical sites and actual ruins, but also in localities where the
settlement to which they belonged has wholly disappeared. Though
simple graves were always in use among the poorest folk, the
commonest form of tomb at all periods is a rock&ndash;cut chamber
entered by a door in one side, to which access is given by a shaft
or sloping passage (<em>dromos</em>) cut likewise in the rock. The
earliest are but a few feet from the surface, just deep enough to
ensure a firm roof to the chamber; later the depth is as much as 12
or 15 feet. Occasionally the chamber, and even the passage, is
built of masonry and roofed with stone slabs or a corbel vault, and
the simple door&ndash;slab gives place to a stone door, hinged, or
sliding in a grooved frame. Cremation was occasionally practised in
the Hellenistic Age, but the regular custom was to bury the body;
during the Bronze Age in a sitting or a contracted posture, in all
later periods lying at full length. Stone coffins
(<em>sarcophagi</em>), with a lid, were used occasionally by the
rich from the sixth century onwards, and wooden coffins in the
Graeco&ndash;Roman period. There is always as rich a
tomb&ndash;equipment as the mourners could afford, of personal
ornaments, wreaths, provisions, weapons, and other gear, especially
pottery; and terra&ndash;cotta figures of men, animals, furniture,
and other objects for the use of the deceased. In
Graeco&ndash;Roman tombs pottery is supplemented or replaced by
glass vessels, and coins are frequent, and are important evidence
of date. Most of our knowledge of Cypriote arts and industries
comes from this tomb&ndash;equipment, which should therefore if
possible be preserved entire and kept together, tomb by tomb; not
neglecting the skeletons themselves, which are of value to indicate
changes in the island population. The position of tombs was often
marked by gravestones above ground; these remain scattered in the
surface soil, or collected to block the entrances to later tombs.
They are frequently inscribed. A very common form in
Greco&ndash;Roman times is the <em>cippus</em> , a short column,
like an altar.</p>

<p><b>Pottery and other objects</b> from tombs, and also from
settlements, is classified as follows:</p>

<p><em>Stone Age</em>: not clearly represented in Cyprus; but some
of the earliest tombs (with rude varieties of red hand&ndash;made
ware) contain no metallic objects, and may belong to the latest
neolithic period. Stone implements are very rare, and should be
carefully recorded, with a note of the spot where they were
found.</p>

<p><em>Bronze Age, early period</em> (before 2000 B.C.): polished
red ware, hand&ndash;made, sometimes with incised ornament filled
with white powder.</p>

<p><em>Bronze Age, middle period</em> (2000&ndash;1500 B.C.):
polished red ware, and also white hand&ndash;made ware with painted
linear ornament in dull black or brown.</p>

<p><em>Bronze Age, late period</em> (1500&ndash;1200 B.C.):
degenerate polished red and painted white ware; wheel&ndash;made
white ware with painted ornament in glazed black or brown, of the
'Late Minoan' or 'Mycenaean' style introduced from the Aegean;
various hand&ndash;made wares of foreign styles, probably from
Syria or Asia Minor.</p>

<p>In these periods, weapons, implements, and ornaments are of
copper (with bronze in the 'late' period); gold occurs rarely;
terra&ndash;cotta figures are few and rude; engraved seals are
cylindrical like those of Babylonia.</p>

<p><em>Early Iron Age</em>: wheel&ndash;made pottery, either white
or bright red, with painted geometrical ornament in black
(supplemented on the white ware with purple&ndash;red); there is
also a black fabric imitating metallic forms.</p>

<p><em>The early period</em> (1200&ndash;1000 B.C.) marks the
transition from bronze to iron implements, with survival of
Mycenaean decoration on the pottery, and replacement of cylindrical
by conical seals.</p>

<p><em>The middle period</em> (1000&ndash;750 B.C.) has purely
geometrical decoration: terra&ndash;cotta figures are modelled
rudely by hand, and painted like the pottery.</p>

<p><em>The late period</em> (750&ndash;500 B.C.) shows foreign
influences from Greece and from Phoenicia or Egypt, competing with
and enriching the native geometrical style. Scarab seals,
blue&ndash;glaze beads, and other personal ornaments, and silver
objects, appear. Terra&ndash;cotta figures stamped in a mould occur
side by side with modelled.</p>

<p><em>Hellenic Age</em>, with increasing influence of Greek arts
and industries.</p>

<p><em>Early or Hellenic period</em> (500&ndash;300 B.C.): the
native pottery degenerates, and Greek vases and terra&ndash;cottas
are imported and imitated; jewellery of gold and silver is fairly
common and of good quality; with engraved seals set in signet
rings: the bronze mirrors are circular, with a
handle&ndash;spike.</p>

<p><em>Middle or Hellenistic period</em> (300&ndash;50 B.C.): the
native pottery is almost wholly replaced by imitations of forms
from other parts of the Greek world, especially from Syria and Asia
Minor: large handled wine&ndash;jars ( <em>amphorae</em> ) are
common: terra&ndash;cottas and jewellery also follow Greek styles:
coloured stones are set in rings and ear&ndash;rings.</p>

<p><em>Late or Graeco&ndash;Roman period</em> (50 B.C.&ndash;A.D.
400): pottery is partly replaced by vessels of blown glass: clay
lamps, red&ndash;glazed jugs, so called 'tear&ndash;bottles' of
spindle&ndash;shapes, ear&ndash;rings of beads strung on wire,
bronze rings and bracelets, circular mirrors without handles, and
bronze coins are characteristics.</p>

<p><em>Byzantine Age</em> (after A.D. 400): Christian burial in
surface graves supersedes the use of rock&ndash;hewn tombs:
funerary equipment goes out of use, except a few personal
ornaments, which are of mean appearance, and may bear Christian
symbols. Domestic pottery is coarse, ungraceful, and frequently
ribbed on the outside. Clay lamps have long nozzles, and Christian
symbols. Glass becomes clumsy and less common; and glazed bowls and
cups come into use. Occasional rich finds of silver plate (salvers,
cups, spoons, &amp;c.) and personal ornaments, have been made among
Byzantine ruins.</p>

<p>On mediaeval and later sites, various glazed fabrics of pottery
are found, and occasionally examples of the glazed and painted
jugs, plates, and tiles known to collectors as 'Rhodian' or
'Damascus' ware.</p>

<p><b>Inscriptions</b> occur on settlement&ndash;sites, in
sanctuaries and associated with tombs: usually cut on slabs or
blocks of soft limestone, though marble and other harder stones
were used in Hellenistic and Roman times. Besides the ordinary
Greek (see <a href="#ill4">Illustration IV</a>), and Roman alphabets
the Phoenician
alphabet (see <a href="#ill10">Illustrations X</a> and <a
href="#ill11">XI</a>) was in use at Kition
(Larnaca), in the great sanctuaries at Idalion (Dali), and
occasionally elsewhere; and from early times until the fourth
century a syllabary peculiar to Cyprus, often very rudely hewn, in
irregular lines, on ill&ndash;shaped blocks. Such 'Cypriote
inscriptions' (see accompanying <a href="#ill7">Illustration VII</a>)
are of great
value and interest, and have been often overlooked among building
material drawn from old sites. In all doubtful cases, a 'squeeze'
should be made by one of the methods described in the first part of
this volume and submitted to the Keeper of Antiquities. The stamped
inscriptions on the handles of wine&ndash;jars are worth
preserving, as evidence for the course of trade.</p>

<p><b>Coins</b> were issued in Cyprus from the sixth century
onward; first in silver; later (in the fourth century B.C.)
occasionally in gold, and from the fourth century commonly in
copper. A Ptolemaic coinage succeeded in the third century that of
the local rulers; the Roman coinage, with inscriptions sometimes in
Greek, sometimes in Latin, lasts from Augustus to the beginning of
the third century. Coins of the Byzantine Emperors and of the
Lusignan Kings are common.</p>

<p>The following notes are to be accepted as only a rough and
imperfect guide, since no part of Syria, north of Palestine, has
been widely or minutely explored, and the archaeology of the
earliest period, in Central Syria, for example, is almost
unknown.</p>

<p>The periods into which the archaeological history of Syria
should be divided are roughly, as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. Neolithic and Chalcolithic Age, to
about 2000 B.C.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II. Bronze Age or Early Hittite, to about 1100
B.C.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;III. Iron Age or Late Hittite, to about 550 B.C.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV. Persian Period, to about 330 B.C.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V. Hellenistic Period, to about 100
B.C.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI. Roman Period.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;VII. Byzantine Period.</p>

<p class= "centclass">I. <em>Neolithic.</em></p>

<p>No purely Neolithic sites yet known, but lowest strata of
remains at Sakjegzu and Sinjerli, on the Carchemish citadel, and
in certain kilns at Yunus near by, and also pot&ndash;burials among
house remains are of this Age. (But see Chapter VIII, Mesopotamia,
whose Neolithic period is similar.)</p>

<p><b>Stone implements:</b> as in Greece, including obsidian of
very clear texture, probably of inner Asiatic, not Aegean
production. Bone needles and other implements.</p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b> Four varieties have been observed: (1) buff
ground with simple linear decoration applied direct on the gritty
body&ndash;clay in lustreless pigments, black,
chocolate&ndash;brown, or red, according to the firing; (2)
greenish&ndash;buff face, hand&ndash;polished, with polychrome
varnish decoration of vandykes and other geometric motives; (3)
monochrome, black to grey, not burnished, but sometimes decorated
with incised linear patterns; (4) plain red or buff (e.g. large
urns in which Neolithic burials were found on the Carchemish
citadel). All pottery hand&ndash;made.</p>

<p><em>Figurines</em> : rude clay and stone figurines are likely to
occur, but have as yet been found very rarely in Neolithic
strata.</p>

<p><em>Copper implements</em>: traces observed at Carchemish: to be
looked for.</p>

<p class= "centclass">II. <em>Bronze Age (Early Hittite).</em></p>

<p>(a) Early period to about 1500 B.C. Cist&ndash;graves made of
rough stone slabs, near crude brick houses. Conjunction of such
slabs with bricks would be an indication of an early Bronze Age
site. Rare pot&ndash;burials survive.</p>

<p><b>Implements.</b> Spear&ndash;heads of long tapering form
rounded sharply at the base which has long tang (<a
href="#ill9">IX</a>, Fig. 5):
poker&ndash;like butts (<a href="#ill9">IX</a>, Fig. 2): knives with
curved tangs:
'toggle' pins: all bronze (but a silver toggle&ndash;pin has been
found) (<a href="#ill9">IX</a>, Figs. 1,8).</p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b> All wheel&ndash;made but rough: light red or
buff faced of reddish clay: decoration rare and only in simple
zigzags or waves in reddish&ndash;brown pigment: long&ndash;stemmed
vases of 'champagne&ndash;glass' form are common (<a
href="#ill8">VIII</a>, Fig. 4):
rarely a creamy slip is applied to the red clay.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Later period.</em> Cist&ndash;graves apart from houses,
in cemeteries.</p>

<p><b>Implements.</b> Long narrow celts often riveted:
spear&ndash;heads, leaf&ndash;shaped or triangular (<a
href="#ill9">IX</a>, Figs. 3, 6,
10): axe&ndash;heads with socket, swelling blade and curved cutting
edge: pins both 'toggle' and unpierced, straight and bent over.</p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b> Wheel&ndash;made, well potted, and commonly
<em>ring&ndash;burnished</em>, the process beginning at the base of
a vase and climbing spirally: little painted decoration: face
usually dusky brown over pinkish body clay, but red and
yellow&ndash;white faced wares also found: shapes, mostly bowls,
open and half closed: ring feet, but no handles to vases: only
occasionally lug&ndash;ears (<a href="#ill9">IX</a>, Figs.
1,2,3,5,6). Rims well turned
over belong to the latest period, in which elaborate
<em>ring&ndash;burnishing</em> is common.</p>

<p><b>Beads, &amp;c.</b> Diamond&ndash;shaped, with incised
decoration, in clay or stone, common. Pendants, &amp;c., of shell,
lapis lazuli, cornelian, crystal. Cylinders, of rude design like
Babylonian First Dynasty, in stone and bone. Spindle&ndash;whorls
in steatite and clay.</p>

<h4>Illustration VIII: Syrian Pottery</h4>

<br>
<br>
<p class= "centclass">III. <em>Iron Age (Late Hittite).</em></p>

<p>To this belong the mass of 'Hittite' remains in Syria. Graves
are unlined pits, with urn burials, the corpse having been
cremated. Cylinders, &amp;c., showing traces of fire, will belong
to this Age.</p>

<p><b>Implements and weapons.</b> Arrow&ndash;heads of bronze:
spear&ndash;heads of bronze and iron: axes, knives, and picks of
iron (miniature models occur in graves): daggers of iron.
<em>Fibulae</em> , of bronze, semicircular and triangular (as in
Asia Minor) (<a href="#ill9">IX</a>, Figs. 4, 9, 11): plain armlets
of bronze: pins,
spatulae, &amp;c., of bronze: thin appliqu ornaments. Bronze bowls
(gilt) with gadroon or lotus ornament (moulded) in later period.
Steatite censers, in form of a cup held by a human hand, are not
uncommon (<a href="#ill9">IX</a>, Fig. 7).</p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b> Tall narrow&ndash;mouthed urns,
bath&ndash;shaped vessels, and bell&ndash;kraters common (<a
href="#ill8">VIII</a>,
Fig. 10): trefoil&ndash;mouth <em>oenochoae</em> and
<em>hydriae</em> ; also <em>amphorae</em> (<a href="#ill8">VIII</a>,
Fig. 7).</p>

<p>In earlier period, white or drab slipped surface with geometric
patterns (rarely rude birds) in black. In later period, pinkish
glaze with geometric patterns in black&ndash;brown, concentric
circles being a common motive. Tripod bowls in unslipped 'kitchen'
ware (<a href="#ill8">VIII</a>, Fig. 8). Blue or greenish glazed
albarelli, with white,
brown, or yellow bands, occur (as in Rhodes).</p>

<p><b>Figurines.</b> Drab clay, painted with red or black bands and
details. Two types: (a) Horsemen; (b) Goddesses of columnar shape,
often with flower headdresses, and sometimes carrying a child.</p>

<p><b>Seals, &amp;c.</b> Scarabs with designs of Egyptian
appearance: cylinders, steatite or (more commonly) glazed paste,
lightly and often scratchily engraved: hard stone seals finely
engraved: flattened spheroids in steatite with Hittite symbols on
both faces, inscriptions being often garbled.</p>

<p><b>Inscriptions.</b> Most of those in <b>Hittite</b> script,
both relieved and incised, found in Syria, are of this Age, but
chiefly of the earlier part of it (cf. <a href="#ill6">Illustration
VI</a>). Those in
<b>Semitic</b> characters begin in this Age; and to its later part
(8th&ndash;7th cents.) belong important Aramaic inscriptions, e.g.
the Bar&ndash;Rekub monuments of Sinjerli (Shamal). See tables of
letter&ndash;forms appended to Palestine section, <a
href="#ill10">Illustrations X</a>
&amp; <a href="#ill11">XI</a>.</p>

<p class= "centclass">IV. Persian Period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Imported Egyptian and Egypto&ndash;Phoenician objects
(bronze bowls as in Age III: scarabs: figure&ndash;amulets),
Rhodian (pottery), Attic (coins, small black&ndash;figure vases,
&amp;c.).</p>

<p><b>Weapons and implements.</b> Iron. Long swords: spearheads,
socketed, often with square or diamond mid&ndash;rib: short
double&ndash;edged daggers with round pommels: chapes (bronze) with
moulded or beaten relief&ndash;work: knives, small and slightly
curved: arrow&ndash;heads (usually bronze and triangular):
horse&ndash; bits (usually bronze) with heavy knobbed
side&ndash;bars: ear&ndash;rings, wire armlets and pins (generally
plain) of bronze: <em>fibulae</em> as in Age III: circular mirrors,
plain, of bronze: anklets of heavy bronze: kohl&ndash;pots, bronze,
of hollow cylindrical form, with plain sticks.</p>

<p><b>Pottery.</b> As in Age II, plain, polished, rarely
ring&ndash;burnished, but of less careful workmanship (<a
href="#ill8">VIII</a>, Fig.
9.) Glazed albarelli, 'pilgrim&ndash;bottles', aryballi, &amp;c.,
(as in Age III) common. White&ndash;yellow slipped ware with bands
of black survives rarely from Age III.</p>

<p><b>Stone vessels.</b> Bowls on inverted cup&ndash;shaped feet
not uncommon (<a href="#ill8">VIII</a>, Fig. 11).</p>

<p><b>Beads and seals.</b> Eye&ndash;beads in mosaic glass, and
other glass beads (hard stone and bronze more rarely): conoid seals
in hard crystalline stones, usually engraved with figure praying to
the Moon&ndash;god: also soft stone, glass and paste conoids.
Scarabs and scaraboids in paste. Cylinders become scarce.</p>

<p class= "centclass">V. <em>Hellenistic.</em> VI. <em>Roman.</em> VII.
<em>Byzantine.</em></p>

<p>Most of the characteristic Syrian products of all these Periods
do not differ materially from those found in other East
Mediterranean lands, e.g. Greece and Asia Minor. The change to
Persian (Sassanian) types comes in the late seventh century
A.D.</p>

<p>Two classes of objects, examples of the first of which are
mostly of Age III, but may be Persian, Hellenistic, or even Roman,
are very commonly met with in Syria:</p>

<p><b>1. Figurines,</b> single or in pairs or threes, of bronze or
terra&ndash;cotta, representing cult&ndash;types. Most common is a
standing god with peaked cap, short tunic, and arm raised in act of
smiting: a seated goddess also common: figures of animals,
especially a bull; and phallic objects (these mainly Roman).</p>

<p><b>2. Glass</b> plain (iridescent from decay), ribbed, or
moulded, in great variety of forms&ndash;bowls, jugs, cups, &amp;c.
Mostly late Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine, and especially
common and of fine quality in the Orontes valley.</p>

<p>Parti&ndash;coloured glass (with white or yellow bands and
threads) is earlier (Persian Period). Painted and enamelled glass
with gilt or polychrome designs is later (ninth to fifteenth
century, Arab).</p>

<h4>I. General Principles.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>1. Study of the <b>pottery</b> of the country, not merely from
books but from actual specimens, is an absolutely essential
preliminary. Without an acquaintance with this branch of
Palestinian archaeology, so thorough that any sherd presenting the
least character can be immediately assigned to its proper period,
no field research of any value can be carried out. (See further V
below.)</p>

<p>2. A knowledge of the various Semitic alphabets is necessary for
copying inscriptions. Unless the traveller be also acquainted with
the languages he had better be cautious about copying Semitic
inscriptions; without such knowledge he runs the risk of confusing
different Semitic letters, which often closely resemble one
another. He should, however, be able to make squeezes and
photographs.</p>

<p>The following are the languages and scripts which may be found
in Palestinian Epigraphy.</p>

<p>Tables of the chief alphabetic and numeral forms of the West
Semitic scripts are given in <a href="#ill10">Illustrations X</a>
&amp; <a href="#ill11">XI</a>; for the
Greek, see <a href="#ill4">Illustration IV</a>.</p>

<p>3. The traveller should have had practice in making measured
drawings<br>
of buildings.</p>

<p>4. For some branches of work a good knowledge of Arabic is<br>
indispensable&mdash;not the miserable pidgin jargon usually spoken
by Europeans, nor yet the highly complex literary language, which
is unintelligible to the ordinary native, but the colloquial of the
country, spoken grammatically and properly pronounced. Work done
through dragomans is never entirely satisfactory, because it
requires the unattainable condition that the dragoman should be as
much a scientific student of anthropology and of archaeology as the
traveller himself.</p>

<p>5. The student for whom these pages are written should not
attempt any excavation, unless he has been trained under a
practical excavator, and has learnt how work, which is essentially
and inevitably destructive of evidence, can be made to yield
profitable fruit. There is plenty of work that can be done on the
surface of the ground without excavation.</p>

<br>
<h4>II. Sites of Towns and Villages.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>1. <b>Nomenclature.</b> The sites of ancient towns and villages
are usually conspicuous in Palestine, and are recognized in the
local nomenclature. They are denoted by the words <em>tall</em> ,
plural <em>tull</em> , meaning 'mound', and <em>khirbah</em> ,
plural <em>khirab</em> meaning 'ruin'. These words are commonly
spelt in English <em>tell</em> and <em>khirbet</em> (less correctly
<em>khurbet</em> ) and we use these more familiar forms here. As a
rule, though not invariably, the sense of these terms is
distinguished. A tell is a site represented by a mound of
stratified accumulation, the result of occupation extending over
many centuries, and easily recognizable among natural hillocks by
its regular shape, smooth sides, and flat top. A khirbet is a field
of ruins in which there is little or no stratification. Nearly all
the sites of the latter type are the remains of villages not older
than the Byzantine or Roman period.</p>

<p>2. <b>Identification of ancient sites.</b> This is a task less
easy than it appears to be, and many of the current identifications
of Biblical sites call for revision. Similarity of name, on which
most of these identifications depend, is apt to be misleading; in
many cases sites identified thus with Old Testament places are not
older than the Byzantine Period. [1] This similarity of name may
sometimes be a mere accident; it may also sometimes be accounted
for by a transference of site, the inhabitants having for some
special reason moved their town to a new situation. In such cases
the tell representing the older site may perhaps await
identification in the neighbourhood. In attempting to establish
identifications, the date of the site, as determined from the
potsherds, and its suitability to the recorded history of the
ancient site in question, are elements of equal importance with its
name.</p>

<p><small>[1] An example is Khirbet Teku'a, long identified with
the Biblical Tekoa.</small></p>

<p>Note: The traveller should be cautioned against embarking on the
study of place&ndash;names, identification of scriptural sites,
&amp;c., before mastering the principles of Arabic phonetics. Many
of the attempts made at rendering the names of Palestinian
place&ndash;names in European books are simply grotesque. The
following are the chief pitfalls:</p>

<p><small>&nbsp;(1) Confusion of the vowels, the pronunciation of
which is obscure.<br>
 &nbsp;(2) The consonant <em>'ain</em> , to which the untrained
European ear is deaf, and which in consequence is often omitted.
Less frequently it may be over&ndash;conscientiously inserted in a
place where it does not exist. Sometimes the <em>'ain</em> and its
associated vowel are transposed (as <em>M'alula</em> for
<em>Ma'lula</em> ) making unpronounceable combinations of
consonants.<br>
&nbsp;(3) The letter <em>kaf</em> , often dropped in pronunciation,
and therefore often omitted.<br>
&nbsp;(4) The letter <em>ghain</em> , which an unaccustomed ear
confuses with either <em>g</em> or <em>r</em><br>
 &nbsp;(5) The reduplicated letters, which a European is apt to
hear and to write as single.<br>
&nbsp;(6) The nuances between the different <em>d</em> , <em>h</em>
, <em>k</em> , <em>t</em> , and <em>s</em> sounds.</small></p>

<p><b>3. Surface&ndash;exploration of a tell.</b> The
stratification can rarely be studied on the surface only:
superficial indications of this are obscured by the plough,
weather, vegetation, and the activities of modern natives who grub
for building&ndash;stone and for the chance of buried treasure.
Only by trenching can the strata be exposed. An exception to this
rule is afforded by <em>Tell el&ndash;Hesy</em> (Lachish) explored
by Dr. Petrie in 1890&ndash;1: here the erosion of a stream had
exposed enough of the strata for a reconnaissance. In the majority
of cases the most that a visitor can hope to do is to pick up stray
antiquities on the surface of the ground, and ascertain therefrom
the limits of date.</p>

<p>The chief clue is afforded by the pottery (see below, V), sherds
of which, large and small, are strewn in considerable numbers on
every ancient site. Scarabs, seals, bronze implements, iron
fragments, beads, bone ornaments, and the like may also be noticed.
A trained eye is essential even for such surface finds: one man may
walk over a mound and find nothing, another may walk in his steps
and gather quite an interesting harvest of small objects.</p>

<p>Surface indications of buried buildings (or rather foundations)
may be noted both on the top and on the sides of a tell. Lines of
wall may not infrequently be traced. Often the vegetation growing
on the surface indicates the presence of structures underneath
(either by burnt&ndash;up patches amid luxuriant growths, or vice
versa).</p>

<p><b>4. Surface exploration of a khirbet.</b> The task here is,
generally sneaking, simpler. In a khirbet there is usually no great
depth of accumulation; indeed, the bare rock frequently crops up in
the middle of such a site. There is, therefore, as a rule only one
historical period represented. Potsherds, coins (Roman, Jewish,
Byzantine, early Islamic, sometimes Crusader), tesserae of mosaic
pavements, fragments of iron nails, beads, minute metal ornaments
(as bronze wire finger&ndash;rings) are to be picked up on khirbet
sites.</p>

<p>The remains of walls are usually more easily traceable in
khirbet than in tell sites, though much damage has been done by
quarrying for modern buildings. These walls should be carefully
examined: buildings other than mere houses (churches, synagogues,
baths) may sometimes be detected. Cisterns should be noted. Some of
these are not very obvious and the traveller should be on his guard
against falling into them.</p>

<p>All stones should be examined, as there is a chance of finding
inscriptions.</p>

<p>5. In all work on ancient sites the investigator must make a
point of noting everything, irrespective of its apparent
importance, and of carefully training a critical judgement in
interpreting his observations. It is impossible to lay down general
principles that govern every case completely: every site presents
its own individual problems.</p>

<h4>III. Rock&ndash;cut Tombs.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<p>1. All Palestine is honeycombed with rock&ndash;cut tombs, which
form a fascinating and inexhaustible field of study. Unfortunately
all that are in the least degree visible have long ago been rifled,
and in recent years those pests, the curio&ndash;hunting tourists,
have done incalculable harm by stimulating the native
tomb&ndash;robber and dealer.</p>

<p>2. The explorer of rock&ndash;cut tombs must be indifferent to
mud, damp, evil smells, noxious insects, and other discomforts, and
he must be prepared to squeeze through very narrow passages, much
clogged with earth. He is recommended to be on his guard against
scorpions and snakes.</p>

<p>3. A plan and vertical section of the tomb should be drawn. The
measurements should be taken carefully, not only for the sake of
the accuracy of the plan, but also for metrological purposes.</p>

<p>4. The rock outside the entrance of the tomb&ndash;chamber
should be examined. It often shows rebating or other cutting,
designed to receive the foundations of a masonry mausoleum
(resembling in general style the rock&ndash;hewn monuments in the
Kedron Valley at Jerusalem). As a rule such structures have been
entirely destroyed for the sake of their stones.</p>

<p>5. The tool&ndash;marks of the tomb&ndash;quarriers should be
examined, as they sometimes reveal interesting technical
points.</p>

<p>6. Every inch of the surface of the excavation, inside and out,
must be examined for ornaments, symbols, or inscriptions. These may
be either cut or painted, and often are very inconspicuous.
Ornaments are usually floral in type, though in late tombs
figure&ndash;subjects are occasionally to be found. Symbols are
either Jewish (the seven&ndash; branched candlestick) or Christian
(the cross, A&ndash;&Omega;, or the like). Inscriptions are not
necessarily formally cut: they are sometimes mere scratched
graffiti, which would be sure to escape notice unless carefully
looked for (as in the so&ndash;called 'Tombs of the Prophets' on
the Mount of Olives).</p>

<p><b>7. Dating of tombs.</b> The savage rifling to which
Palestinian tombs have been subjected has much reduced the material
available for dating them. The following general principles apply
to Southern Palestine: those in Northern Palestine and Syria still
await a more exact study:</p>

<p>The earliest tombs known in the country were mere natural caves,
into which the dead were cast, often very unceremoniously.</p>

<p>In the <em>Second Semitic Period</em> (<em>circa.</em>
1800&ndash;1400 B.C.) hewn chambers began to be used. These are in
the form of cylindrical shafts with a doorway at the bottom leading
sideways into the burial&ndash;chamber. Natural caves are still
frequently used.</p>

<p>In the <em>Third Semitic Period</em> (<em>circa.</em>
1400&ndash;1000 B.C.) the shaft: form disappears and an artificial
cave, rudely hewn out, takes its place. The entrance is in the side
of the chamber, though not necessarily at the level of the floor.
Rude shelves for the reception of the bodies are sometimes, but not
always, cut in the sides of the chamber.</p>

<p>In the <em>Fourth Semitic Period</em> (<em>circa.</em>
1000&ndash;550 B.C.) the tomb&ndash;chambers are of the same kind,
but are as a rule smaller.</p>

<p>In Southern Palestine the well&ndash;made tomb&ndash;chambers,
such as are to be seen in great numbers around Jerusalem, are all
post&ndash;exilic. There is an immense variety in plan, some tombs
being single chambers, others complications of several chambers.
The late excavation absurdly called the 'Tombs of the Kings' at
Jerusalem is quite a labyrinth of rockcut chambers. In exploring
such a structure a careful search should be made for devices for
deluding thieves: special precautions are sometimes taken to
conceal the entrance to inner groups of chambers. There are some
interesting examples of this in the cemetery in the <em>Wadi
er&ndash;Rababi</em>, south of Jerusalem. However, all tombs of
this period fall into two groups, <em>kk</em> tombs and
<em>arcosolium</em> tombs. In the former the receptacles for bodies
are of the kind known by the Hebrew name <em>kkm</em>
&mdash;shafts, of a size to accommodate one body (sometimes large
enough for two or three) driven horizontally into the wall of the
chamber. In the normal <em>kk</em> tomb&ndash;chamber there are
nine <em>kkm</em> , three in each wall except the wall containing
the entrance doorway. But there are many other arrangements. In the
'Tombs of the Judges' there is a double row of <em>kkm</em> in
the entrance chamber. The explorer should not forget that a
<em>kk</em> sometimes contains a secret entrance to further
chambers at its inner end. In <em>arcosolium</em> tombs the
receptacles are benches cut in the wall, like the berths in a
steamer's cabin. These are sometimes sunk, so as to resemble
rock&ndash;cut sarcophagi.</p>

<p>The late tombs round Jerusalem are in the form of caves driven
horizontally into the hill&ndash;sides. Further south, e.g. in the
region round Beit Jibrin, they are more frequently sunk vertically,
the entrance being in the roof of the burial chamber, or approached
by a square shaft (a reversion to the Second Semitic form, except
that these latter have <em>round</em> shafts).</p>

<h4>IV. Caves.</h4>

<p>The history of the artificial caves hewn in the soft limestone
of Palestine, is quite unknown. The caves of the neighbourhood of
Beit Jibrin provide ample material for several months'
exploration.</p>

<p>Though the caves are labyrinthine there is little fear of an
explorer losing his way: he should, however, be well provided with
lights, as it would be extremely awkward to be left in the
innermost recess of a cave consisting of ten or a dozen chambers
united by narrow creep&ndash; passages, without adequate
illumination. There are occasionally unexpected and dangerous
pitfalls: and hyenas and serpents often shelter in the caves. The
present writer has explored many of them entirely alone, but this
is, on the whole, not to be recommended.</p>

<p>Besides planning the cave, its walls should be searched for
inscriptions, &amp;c. It should be remembered, however, that these
may have been added at any time and do not necessarily belong to
the original excavation. Symbols, apparently of a phallic nature,
are sometimes cut on the walls, as well as crosses and other
Christian devices, and Cufic inscriptions. Frequently the walls are
pitted with the loculi of a columbarium, which, however, appear to
be too small to receive cinerary urns and must be intended for some
other purpose.</p>

<h4>V. Pottery.</h4>

<p>&nbsp;Owing to the importance of the subject a special section
on Pottery is given here, and the two accompanying plates (<a
href="#ill12">XII</a>)
show some of the commonest types of vessels. But the student cannot
learn all he will need to know of Palestinian pottery from a few
pages of print. A representative series of specimens will be found
in the Jerusalem Museum: he may supplement his study of these by
the perusal of reports on excavations, such as Petrie, <em>Tell
el&ndash;Hesy</em> (pp. 40&ndash;50); Bliss, <em>A Mound of Many
Cities</em> (passim); <em>Excavations in Palestine</em> (pp.
71&ndash;141); Macalister, <em>Excavation of Gezer</em> (vol. ii,
pp. 128&ndash;239; and plates); Sellin, <em>Jericho</em> ;
Schumacher, <em>Tell el&ndash;Mutasellim</em></p>

<p><em>Pre&ndash;Semitic Period</em> (down to <em>circa.</em> 2000
B.C.). Ware hand&ndash;modelled, without wheel, coarse, gritty, and
generally soft&ndash;baked and very porous. The section of a clean
fracture is usually of a dirty yellowish colour, resembling in
appearance coarse oatmeal porridge. Bases usually flat,
loop&ndash;handles or wavy handles on the bodies of the vessels:
mouths wide and lips curved outward. The body of the vessel often
decorated with drip lines or with a criss&ndash;cross, in red
paint.</p>

<p><em>First Semitic Period</em> (<em>circa.</em> 2000&ndash;1800
B.C.). Similar to the last: but the potter's wheel is used, and
horizontal painted and moulded rope&ndash;like ornament also found.
Combed ornament and burnished lines frequent.</p>

<p><em>Second Semitic Period</em> (<em>circa.</em> 1800&ndash;1400
B.C.). During this period imports from Egypt, Crete, the Aegean
Sea, and especially Cyprus were common, and potsherds originating
in those countries are frequently to be picked up: also local
imitations of these foreign wares. The ware of this period is on
the whole well&ndash; refined and well&ndash;modelled: the most
graceful shapes, in jugs and bowls, belong to it. Elaborate
polychrome decoration, including figures of birds. But little
moulded ornament.</p>

<p><em>Third Semitic Period</em> (<em>circa.</em> 1400&ndash;1000
B.C.). The same foreign influences are traceable, but rather as
reminiscent local imitations than as direct imports. Late Minoan
[Mycenaean] sherds are, however, frequent. The shapes of vessels
are less artistic than in the preceding period: the painted
ornament is also degenerated, being traced in wiry lines rather
than in the bold wash of the preceding period.</p>

<p><em>Fourth Semitic Period</em> (<em>circa.</em> 1000&ndash;550
B.C.). Late Cypriote imports. The local ware very poor, coarse,
gritty, inartistic. No painted ornament except mere lines: clumsy
moulded ornament frequent.</p>

<p><em>Post&ndash;Exilic and Hellenistic Period</em>
(<em>circa.</em> 550&ndash;100 B.C.). Imports from Greece (sometimes
fragments of black or red figured vases, or lekythoi) and from the
Aegean Islands (especially wine&ndash;jars from Rhodes: stamped
handles of such are frequent). The native ware is easily
recognizable by its smoothness and hardness; when struck with a
stick a sherd emits a musical clink. The vessels are very fair
imitations of classical models, occasionally with painted ornament,
but more frequently moulded.</p>

<p><em>Roman and Byzantine Period</em> (<em>circa.</em> 100
B.C.&ndash;A.D. 600). The unmistakable character of the ware of
this period is the ribbed surface, with which nearly all vessels
are decorated. Fragments of ribbed pottery are strewn almost over
all Palestine. Ornament consisting of repeated impressions of
stamps now begins to appear. Lamps with decoration, inscriptions,
Christian or Jewish symbols common. Glass vessels also
frequent.</p>

<p><em>Arab Period</em> (<em>circa.</em> A.D. 600 onwards). The
early Arab ware often bears painted decoration singularly like that
on Second and Third Semitic pottery, but a fatty soapy texture
characterizes the Arab ware, which is absent from the earlier
sherds. There is likewise a complete absence of representation of
natural forms (birds and the like). In or about the Crusader period
the use of ornamental glaze makes its appearance.</p>

<h4>Illustration XII: Palestinian Pottery Types.</h4>

<br>
<br>


<h4>VI. Sanctuaries.</h4>

<p>The hill&ndash;top shrines, now consecrated to saints of Islam,
are doubtless in origin ancient Canaanite high places. There is
here a rich but a very difficult field for investigation. The
difficulty lies in (a) gaining the confidence of those to whom the
sanctuaries are holy, and (b) guarding against wilful or
unconscious deception. Only long residence and frequent
intercourse, with the Muslim population will make it possible for
any one to obtain really trustworthy information as to the
traditions or the sites of these ancient sanctuaries. A knowledge
of Arabic is essential for a study of the sites themselves, as
there are frequently inscriptions cut or painted on the walls which
should be studied. The casual traveller cannot hope to carry out
researches of any value on these ancient sites.</p>

<p>Sometimes the buildings are Crusaders' churches transformed. The
one really certain fact as to masonry dressing in Palestine may
here conveniently be noticed&mdash;that Crusader structures are
built of well&ndash;squared stones with a plane surface finished
off with a dressing consisting of very fine diagonal lines. Once
seen, this masonry dressing is absolutely unmistakable.</p>

<p>Buildings thus identified as Crusader should be examined for
masons' marks.</p>

<h4>VII. Miscellaneous.</h4>

<p>&nbsp;The following are some other types of ancient remains with
which the traveller may meet almost anywhere in Palestine:</p>

<p>(1) Prehistoric (Stone Age) sites. Marked by being strewn with
flint implements and chips: see a fine collection in the Museum of
the Assumptionists (Notre&ndash;Dame de France) at Jerusalem.
Specimens should be collected and the site mapped.</p>

<p>(2) Dolmens. Frequent east of Jordan; rare, though not unknown,
in Western Palestine. Should be measured, photographed, described,
and mapped.</p>

<p>(3) Rock&ndash;cuttings of various kinds, which should be
measured, planned, and mapped. Among these the commonest are:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Cisterns (usually bottle&ndash;shaped, a narrow
neck expanding below).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Cup&ndash;markings, common everywhere. Often
associated with cisterns.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Wine and olive presses: there is a great variety in
form, but they generally consist of two essential parts&mdash;a
shallow <em>pressing&ndash;vat</em> on which the fruit was
crushed, and a deeper <em>receiving&ndash;vat</em> in which the
expressed juice was collected. The vats are often lined with cement
containing datable potsherds, and are sometimes paved with mosaic
tesserae.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Quarries.</p>

<p>(4) Sacred trees and bushes, recognized by the rags with which
they are festooned. Should be photographed and mapped, and their
legends ascertained, subject to the cautions given above under the
head of Sanctuaries.</p>

<p>(5) Castles and churches, usually of the Crusader period: early
Saracenic buildings. Should be recorded by means of plans,
photographs, measured drawings, and written descriptions.</p>

<p>(6) Mosaic pavements, usually belonging to Byzantine buildings;
should be recorded by means of coloured drawings.</p>

receipts and letters. Abundance of moulded terra&ndash;cottas, and
small lamps.</p>

<p><em>Roman, Second Period</em>, A.D. 300&ndash;641. The
Constantinian Age brings in new styles. Much salmon&ndash;coloured

<p><em>Muhammadan Period.</em> Seventh to fifteenth centuries.
Characterized by great amounts of glazed pottery. Smaller
antiquities found in cemeteries or on ruined sites, the earliest
transitional, and related to Coptic examples of the same kinds.
Pottery: lamps at first continue Christian forms and are unglazed;
afterwards long spouted lamps of dark green glaze. Fragments of
vessels, &amp;c., from the rubbish heaps of old Cairo are glazed; a
typical faience has a soft sandy body of light colour with painted
designs in blue or blue and brown with transparent glaze. Those of
the Mamluk period, and probably some of earlier date, show a
general resemblance to Western Asiatic contemporary wares, due to
importation of potters from Syria, Asia Minor, and Persia (between
twelfth and fifteenth centuries). Other varieties have decoration
in metallic lustre on an opaque white tin glaze; others again have
monochrome glazes imitating imported Chinese wares. Inscriptions
very rare. Glass: if found, is in fragments; rich coloured enamel
designs are seldom earlier than the thirteenth century. Textiles:
chiefly found in small pieces; the colours rich; ornament
consisting of geometrical designs and Cufic inscriptions. Any silk,
or printed patterns, should be secured.</p>

<p>No information about papyri is given here, for the reason that
any site containing them should not be touched except by a trained
excavator.</p>

<p>Mesopotamian antiquities are nearly always found in
<b>Tells</b>, or artificial mounds, which are the sites of ancient
towns or temples. The surrounding plain for a distance of several
hundred yards out, whether steppe&ndash;desert or untilled land,
will usually be found to be productive of antiquities, either a few
inches or few feet deep or, in the case of the dessert, actually
lying upon the surface. These are usually the result of rainstorms
washing out antiquities from the tell itself. Each tell or ganglion
of connected tells usually has a number of small subsidiary tells
round about it, the sites of small isolated buildings or villages
connected with the central settlement. Originally the settlements
were built upon natural rises of the ground which stood up as
islands in the fen&ndash;country.</p>

<p>Visitors should give the local names of tells in Arabic
characters, when possible, so that mistakes in transliteration into
English may be avoided. Antiquities bought in the neighbourhood of
a tell should be noted as coming from that neighbourhood.
Depredations by Arabs (or by others!) should be noted, and reported
to the nearest Political Officer or Inspector of Antiquities. The
barbarous practice of forcibly dislodging inscribed bricks from
walls, as trophies and 'souvenirs', which has unhappily been common
during the war, should never be imitated and always discountenanced
as much as possible.</p>

<p>Other good spots for antiquities than tells are rare. In the
mountainous and stony country of the North we may meet with
<b>rock&ndash; sculptures</b>, as at Bavian, and these should
always be recorded by a traveller, even if he is not certain that
they have not been remarked before: something new may turn up at
any time. Antiquities acquired in the neighbourhood of such
monuments should be noted, and their precise place of origin
ascertained, if possible, as in this way the site of some ancient
settlement adjoining the monument may be identified. The open
ruin&ndash;fields, or <em>Khurbas</em> , characteristic of
Palestine are not usual, except in the case of Parthian or
Sassanian palace ruins such as Ctesiphon, Hatra, or Ukheidhir,
which were often abandoned almost as soon as they were built, so
that no later population could pile up rubbish&ndash;heaps or
graves above them.</p>

<p>In order to aid the visitor to get some idea of the age of a
tell or other site from the antiquities found on its surface and
its neighbourhood, and so to be able to give some idea of what is
likely to be found in it, the following hints have been drawn
up.</p>

<p>In the first place, most of the surface remains, are, as
elsewhere, pottery sherds. These should tell us their date by their
appearance. It must be said, however, that our experience on the
subject of the development of Mesopotamian pottery is limited.
Owing to the attention of Assyriologists having been so long
focussed on the study of the cuneiform records, to the neglect of
general archaeology, we have nothing like the knowledge of these
things that we have in Egypt or in Greece. Such minutiae of
information as our common knowledge of ceramic development in Egypt
or in Greece gives us with regard to these countries, enabling us
to date sites with great accuracy, are not vet available for
Mesopotamia. And if for this reason all possible information as to
the objects found on archaeological sites is desirable, it is also
impossible yet to give the visitor any absolute guide to the
distinctive appearance of pottery at every period. The main periods
are known. The 'prehistoric', the Sumerian, the late Babylonian,
and the Parthian styles are easily distinguishable. If a visitor is
able to tell us that such&ndash;and&ndash;such a mound is
prehistoric or is Parthian, or that settlements of both periods
existed on it, this is what we want. One of the most general of
criteria with regard to pottery is whether it is glazed or not. If
glazed, it is, generally speaking, late. Other things besides
pottery are of course found, and the presence or the absence of
metal, and the occurrence of stone implements, are important. But
it must be remembered that stone was used long into the 'Bronze'
Age, and contemporaneously with copper. There is no sudden break
between the two periods. Fragments of shell and
mother&ndash;of&ndash;pearl, often with incised designs, are very
characteristic of the earliest period. Coins are of late date; a
tell with coins on it is certain to contain buildings as late as
the fourth or third century B.C. (though it may also contain far
older buildings as well). One of the most useful criteria of age
is: Bricks. The form of the brick is a very good guide to date. The
Babylonians used both kiln&ndash;baked and crude bricks. The oldest
type, whether baked or crude, is plano&ndash;convex in form, and
uninscribed. The mortar is bitumen. Later on rectangular bricks,
often square, made in moulds, were introduced. These usually bore
the name of the royal builder. Later on bricks became generally
oblong and much like our own. In the sixth century the square shape
was revived. Both shapes were in use at the Nebuchadnezzar period.
Glazed bricks were then common. Under the Persians mortar took the
place of bitumen. Under the Parthians and Sassanians, bricks were
yellow, oblong, small, and very hard. Details will be found below,
The names of various excavated sites are given in brackets as the
'classical' sources of information on certain points, and as the
places from which type&ndash;antiquities have come to our Museums.
Ancient names are in capitals; museums in italics.</p>

<p>I. PREHISTORIC (?) AGE: <em>Chalcolithic (aeneolithic)
period</em> , before 3500 B.C.</p>

<p>Until quite recently no traces of the Stone Age had been
discovered in Babylonia other than a few possible palaeoliths lying
on the surface of the desert: all traces of a Neolithic Age were
supposed to have been buried beneath the alluvium of the valley. In
Assyria, however, neolithic traces in the shape of obsidian flakes
had been discovered by the late Prof. L. W. King in the course of
his excavation of the mound of Kuyunjik (NINEVEH), besides
fragments of painted pottery resembling those from the earliest
deposits in Asia Minor and those found by the American geologist
Pumpelly in his diggings in the <em>kurgans</em> of Turkestan, (to
which he assigned an extremely remote date B.C.). In Persia, and
about the head of the Persian Gulf, somewhat similar pottery was
discovered by de Morgan and the other French excavators at Susa,
Tep Musyn, Bandar Bushir, and other places: here again the dates
were put at a very remote period. With the exception of a few flint
saw&ndash;blades from Warka [1], Fara, Zurghul, and Babylon [2], no
similar remains had been found in Babylonia until, in 1918, Capt.
R. Campbell Thompson, exploring on behalf of the British Museum,
discovered flint and obsidian flakes and painted pottery lying on
the surface of the desert at Tell Abu Shahrein (ERIDU), and also at
Tell Muqayyar (UR). The continued excavations carried out by Mr. H.
R. Hall for the Museum in 1919 have produced more of the same
evidence from both places, besides a new 'prehistoric' site at Tell
el&ndash;Ma'abed or Tell el&ndash;'Obeid near Ur. It seems that
these antiquities date from the very end of the neolithic, or
rather to the succeeding 'chalcolithic', age; whether they are
really prehistoric, as regards Babylonian history, must until more
evidence from stratified deposits is found remain undecided. They
prove the occupation of the head of the Persian Gulf at the
beginning of history by a people whose primitive art was closely
akin to that of early Elam, and distinct from that of the
Sumerians.</p>

<p><small>[1] Found by Loftus in 1854: their early date was not
recognized at the time.<br>
 [2] Koldewey, <em>Excavations at Babylon, E.T.</em>, p. 261, fig.
182. Koldewey curiously speaks of the saw&ndash;blades as
'palaeolithic.' They are, of course, nothing of the
sort.</small></p>

<p><b>Characteristics:</b> flint, chert, obsidian, green and red
jasper, and quartz&ndash;crystal flakes, arrowheads, cores, and
saw&ndash;blades. Chert and limestone rough hoe&ndash;blades
(easily mistaken for palaeolithic implements; they are, however,
much flatter); polished serpentine or jasper celts; lentoid
(lentil&ndash;shaped), amygdaloid (almond&ndash;shaped), and
discoid beads of cornelian, crystal, obsidian, &amp;c., unpolished;
nails of translucent quartz and obsidian (obviously imitations of
metal types); hard grey pottery sickles, pottery cones of various
sizes, and pottery objects like gigantic nails bent up at the ends;
pottery painted with designs in black, usually geometrical (see
<a href="#ill14">Illustration XIV</a>, Fig. 1), but sometimes showing
plant&ndash;forms
or even animals. This ware is often very fine, so much so as to
look as if wheelmade. The shapes are chiefly bowls (often closely
resembling early Egyptian stone bowl types), pots with
suspension&ndash;handles or lugs, and spouted 'kettles'. All these
objects are at Shahrein and el&ndash;'Obeid found lying on the
desert surface at the distance of 50 or 100 yards from the tell;
they are supposed to have been washed out of the lower strata of
the latter by rains. Objects of this kind should be recorded from
any site, and the neighbourhood of a desert tell should always be
searched for them.</p>

<p>II. EARLY BRONZE (Copper) AGE: <em>First Sumerian
(pre&ndash;Sargonic) Period; c.</em> 3500&ndash;3000 B.C. Earliest
Sumerian civilization.</p>

<p><b>Typical sites.</b> Older strata at Telloh (LAGASH); Fara
(SHURUPPAK); Tell 'Obeid (ancient name as yet unknown); Shahrein
(ERIDU).</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> <em>Writing.</em> First appearance of
script, already conventionalized from pictographs. Cut on stone and
incised on clay tablets and bricks of characteristic early style.
<em>Brick</em> buildings, with crenellated walls (until the
discovery of Tell 'Obeid supposed to date only from the later
Sumerian period) of typical <em>plano&ndash;convex bricks</em> ,
baked or crude, usually with thumb&ndash;mark down length of convex
side (Shahrein), or with two thumb&ndash;holes (for carrying the
brick when wet?), or vent&ndash;holes ('Obeid); at first
uninscribed, later with long inscriptions; measuring 10 x 6 x
2&ndash;2 &frac14; ins. (Shahrein), and 8 x 6 x 2&ndash;2 &frac14;
ins. ('Obeid); poorly shaped and baked (see <a href="#ill14">XIV</a>,
Fig. 3). Bitumen
used for mortar; laid very thick. Hard white stucco on internal
faces of crude brick house walls, often decorated with red, white,
and black painted horizontal stripes (Shahrein.) <em>Pottery.</em>
Wheel and hand&ndash;made; drab, fine or coarse paste, unpainted
and usually undecorated. Typical shapes: (see <a
href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Figs. 2 abc)
mostly handleless vases, and cups, and spouted 'kettles' (again
often resembling early Egyptian types).</p>

<p><em>Metals: Copper.</em> Extensive use: large copper figures of
animals, heads cast, bodies of copper plates fastened by nails over
a core of clay with a mixture of bitumen and straw; the figures
have eyes, tongues, and teeth of red and white stone and nacre
(Tell 'Obeid); goat's head with inlaid eyes of nacre (Fara).
Otherwise ordinary treatment of eye shows a number of wrinkle lines
round it, and it is always disproportionately large (bull's heads,
Tell 'Obeid and Telloh). Small fragments of copper or bronze on the
surface of a tell should never be neglected, as there may be enough
in any fragment to give an idea of possible archaic remains within
the tell.</p>


<p><em>Silver.</em> Rare. Fine engraved vase of Entemena (Telloh,
<em>Louvre</em> ).</p>

<p><em>Gold.</em> Not uncommon. Copper nails with gold&ndash;plated
heads (Shahrein).</p>

<p><em>Stone.</em> Portrait figures in round (Bismya, Telloh,
&amp;c.), usually representing men, with face and head shaven; very
prominent large curved nose; usually squatting with arms crossed,
sometimes standing; only garment a kilt apparently made of locks of
natural wool. Usually inscribed in archaic characters on back of
shoulders. Material: a grey or a white limestone most usual; tufa
and dolerite also used. Reliefs: large stelae (Stele of the
Vultures; Telloh, <em>Louvre</em> , fragment in <em>B. M.</em> ),
completely inscribed; small relief plaques, inscribed (Telloh,
<em>Louvre</em> ). Flint carved and engraved cylinder&ndash; seals,
of limestone, black basalt, jasper, diorite, &amp;c. Vases, bowls,
and cups (usually fragmentary), of white and pink limestone and
breccia. Maceheads of breccia, granite, &amp;c., of same type as
the early Egyptian (Shahrein).</p>

<p><em>Shell.</em> Very largely used for decoration; small plaques
of nacre often engraved with scenes of men worshipping, &amp;c.
(Telloh); tessellated pillars with nacre plaques ('Obeid).
Seal&ndash;cylinders of shell.</p>

<p><em>Wood.</em> Rarely survives; small beams plated with copper
('Obeid).</p>

<p><em>Burials.</em> Pottery coffins with lids, mat burials; bodies
contracted; funerary furniture, copper, stone or pottery drinking
cups held near mouth: copper weapons, fish&ndash;hooks, net
weights; beads of agate, lapis, shell (unpolished);
colour&ndash;dishes, (Fara). (The idea that the Babylonians ever
burnt their dead is now discredited; the supposed
'fire&ndash;necropoles' at Zurghul, &amp;c., are not
substantiated.)</p>

<p>The burials are hard to distinguish from similar contracted
interments of later date, except that the furniture is more
abundant in early times and mat graves are unusual in later days
Mounds of this age may be known by the occurrence on the surface of
scraps of oxydized copper, nails, &amp;c.; shell&ndash;fragments;
undecorated light drab sherds; and the typical small
plano&ndash;convex bricks.</p>

<p>III. M<small>IDDLE</small> B<small>RONZE</small>
A<small>GE</small>. 1. <em>Early Semitic or Akkadian (Sargonid)
period; c.</em> 3000&ndash;2500 B.C.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Less crude style of art: development of
writing (see <a href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Fig. 1); first inscribed clay
tablets of usual
style; beginnings of cuneiform, developed from the archaic
semi&ndash;pictographic character. Bricks still plano&ndash;convex;
stamped inscriptions begin. Stone maceheads of same type as
earlier. Large and well&ndash;cut cylinder&ndash;seals of fine
limestone, lapis, diorite, granite, and shell are characteristic of
the period: they are generally of an easily recognizable form
(reel&ndash;shaped) with sides showing a marked concavity (see <a
href="#ill14">XIV</a>,
Fig. 5). The great development of art is shown by the stele of
Naram&ndash;Sin ( <em>Louvre</em> ) found at Susa. Not many mounds
of this period have been dug.</p>

<p>2. <em>Later Sumerian (Gudea) and early Semitic Babylonian
(Hammurabi) periods; c.</em> 2500&ndash;1800 B.C.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Typical 'Gudea' style of sculpture, in
round and relief (Telloh, <em>Louvre</em> ); materials hard
diorite, dolerite and basalt as well as limestone: characteristic
treatment of eye with heavily marked brows: elaborate tiaras and
head&ndash;dresses of female figures, &amp;c. Very high
development. Regular use of cuneiform on clay tablets and cones
(see <a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Figs. 13&ndash;15); non&ndash;cuneiform
character (in a
developed form) still used in brick stamps (<a href="#ill15">XV</a>,
Fig. 10) and on
stone monuments. Bricks (<a href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Fig. 4) now
rectangular and well
made, either square (14 ins., usually, by 2 &frac12; ins. thick) or
oblong (11 &frac12; x 8 x 2 &frac12; ins., or 10 x 5 x 2 &frac12;
ins.) with stamps or incised inscriptions of Ur&ndash;Engur, Dungi,
Bur&ndash;Sin, Gudea and other kings (<a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig.
10), from Ur,
Shahrein, Telloh, Niffer, &amp;c. Bricks of Bur&ndash;Sin from
Shahrein often have inscription&ndash;stamps also on the smaller
sides (thickness). Great buildings of crude and baked brick
(Telloh, Ur); temple&ndash;towers (ziggurats) of crude brick faced
with burnt brick (Ur, Shahrein, Niffer). Town ruins of Hammurabi's
age (Babylon): crude brick: plans always confused and haphazard.
Bitumen still used for mortar. Burials, contracted, often in double
pots (mouth to mouth), sealed with bitumen. With the bodies are
found large numbers of agate and cornelian beads, unpolished.</p>

<p>Mounds of this period may be recognized by the typical square or
oblong bricks (often with thumb&ndash;holes), with stamps of kings'
names, &amp;c., in non&ndash;cuneiform characters, or with
hand&ndash;incised inscriptions in early cuneiform, made while the
clay was wet; clay tablets or cones inscribed in early cuneiform;
copper nails (those with gold&ndash; plated heads found at Shahrein
may also date from this time); drab or black pottery sherds with
impressed or incised designs, generally rough and evidently made
with a piece of stick or the thumb&ndash;nail; rough stone
quern&ndash;slabs with rubbers, grinding and hammer&ndash;stones,
&amp;c.; and the burials described above (these, however, also
occur in later times).</p>

<p>IV. L<small>ATER</small> B<small>RONZE</small>
A<small>GE</small>: <em>Kassite, Middle Babylonian, and Early
Assyrian periods; c.</em> 1800&ndash; 1000 B.C.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Stabilization of Babylonian art; typical
'Kassite' cylinder&ndash;seals with straight sides (<a
href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Fig. 6);
disappearance of old non&ndash;cuneiform character with gradual
disuse of Sumerian; early stone&ndash;cut inscriptions in cuneiform
(see <a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig. 16; an Elamite inscription).
Occasional and rare
appearance of glazed pottery (imitation of Egyptian), and
multi&ndash;coloured glass; early Assyrian sculpture (those
unversed in minutiae of Mesopotamian art will only be able to tell
this earlier work from the later by the earlier style of the
accompanying inscriptions). Not many mounds of this period have
been dug.</p>

<p>V. E<small>ARLY</small> I<small>RON</small> A<small>GE</small>:
1. <em>Late Babylonian and Assyrian periods; c.</em> 1000&ndash;540
B.C.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Flourishing period of Assyrian art and
writing (for details see the archaeological books, which are very
full on this period). Mounds may be known by the occurrence of
fragments of granite or basalt bowl&ndash;querns, often with feet;
pieces or whole vases of the multi&ndash;coloured opaque glass
usually called 'Phoenician' (which are already found in the
preceding period); alabaster pots; straight&ndash; sided cylinder
seals (see <a href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Fig. 6); Syrian conical seals of
steatite (<a href="#ill14">XIV</a>,
Fig. 7); small and rude clay figures of deities, such as Ishtar or
Papsukal (the guardian of buildings), and animals, such as horses,
sheep, doves, ducks, &amp;c.; bronze pins, often with birds on the
heads; baked clay tablets of the fine Kuyunjik type (see <a
href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig.
12; script, Fig. 17); pottery lamps with long protruding curved
nozzles; pottery vases simple and undecorated save by incised
lines, as for many centuries past (for types see <a
href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Figs. 9 a b c
d); light&ndash;blue glazed ware introduced from Egypt towards end
of period; polychrome glazed ware with designs of rosettes,
chevrons) &amp;c., somewhat earlier; large pots without feet common
for storage of grain and oil, sometimes for tablets: mouth often
closed with a brick. Stone pithoi are also found. Vertical drains
or sinks, made of a number of pottery cylindrical drums, fitting on
top of or into one another, are found everywhere on
town&ndash;mounds of this period; visitors should avoid tumbling
into them, as they are often open or only covered by a very thin
crust of earth. Usually they are perforated to allow of soaking
into the surrounding earth, and are, when excavated whole,
generally found capped by, a beehive&ndash;shaped perforated cover.
Sometimes these drains were made of old pots with their lower parts
broken off, and fitted into one another. Secular buildings were of
burnt brick; sacred buildings usually of crude brick, from
religious conservatism. Crude bricks nearly always oblong; burnt
bricks square (14 ins.) or oblong (9x6x3 ins.). The burnt brick of
Nebuchadnezzar's time is extraordinarily fine and hard, and the
bitumen&ndash;mortar so finely spread as to be almost invisible
(Babylon). Walls of this reign have a rock&ndash;like solidity and
tenacity that should make them easily recognizable. Those of
immediately preceding reigns show the bitumen far more clearly, and
the bricks are usually not as finely made as Nebuchadnezzar's; at
Babylon the latter's work is thus at once distinguishable from that
of Nabopolassar. A typical brick&ndash; inscription of
Nebuchadnezzar is illustrated above, <a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig.
11. It is in the
revived archaic script, always used for this purpose by the late
Babylonian kings. Use of coloured glazed brick is characteristic of
period; often relief figures of animals are made up of glazed
bricks each specially moulded for its proper position and numbered
(Ishtar Gate, Babylon). Royal palaces were often decorated with
reliefs depicting conquests, &amp;c., carved on slabs of
alabastrine marble placed along the brick walls, with great statues
of human&ndash; headed bulls ( <em>Cherubim</em> ), &amp;c. (Nimrud
(CALAH), Kuyunjik (NINEVEH), Khorsabad. <em>Brit. Mus.</em> and
<em>Louvre</em> ) Burials usually in drab clay pot&ndash;coffins
(larnakes) with covers; bodies still contracted; funerary furniture
scanty, consisting chiefly of pins, beads, an occasional
cylinder&ndash;seal, and a few pots (<a href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Figs.
9 a b c d). Ribbed
pots with blue (weathered green) glaze, often pitched both within
and without, were also employed towards the end of the period,
inverted over the bodies. Also anthropoid pottery sarcophagi, an
idea imported from Egypt. Child burials in bowls. Iron objects
sometimes buried with the dead; often found in palace&ndash;ruins
(weapons, horse&ndash;furniture, &amp;c.). Bronze commonly used for
gates, door, bolts, &amp;c. (Gates of Shalmaneser's palace;
<em>Brit. Mus.</em> ).</p>

<p>2. <em>Persian (Achaemenian) period: c.</em>540&ndash;330
B.C.</p>

<p>This period is distinguished from the former by the less
frequent use of bronze, the introduction of coinage, and the
development of the simplified Persian cuneiform writing (never on
tablets, only on stone monuments; see <a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig.
18). Bitumen ceased
to be used as mortar in buildings. Persian walls (e. g. the Apadana
at Babylon) are easily distinguished by the use of clay mortar, and
the unusual thickness of the mortar&ndash;courses between the
bricks. Burials in shallow trough&ndash;like pottery coffins, with
the bodies at full length, but with the knees slightly flexed
(these continued during the next period).</p>

<p>VI. M<small>IDDLE</small> I<small>RON</small>
A<small>GE</small>: 1. <em>Greek and Parthian periods; c.</em>330
B.C.&ndash;220 A.D.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Sudden degeneration and disappearance of
the ancient native civilization and art; imitation of Greek
culture, Greek buildings (theatre at Babylon), and inscriptions;
Greek legends on Parthian coins; Parthian kings call themselves
'Philhellenes'; Graeco&ndash;Roman architecture imitated (Hatra).
Graeco&ndash;Roman terra&ndash; cottas, pottery lamps,
pilgrim&ndash;flasks and bone&ndash;carvings; classical seal gems;
Roman glass; fragments of imitation of classical sculpture in
marble (the material being adopted as well as the style); and, of
course, coins&mdash;these are characteristic remains found on
mounds of this period. About l00 B.C. the use of cuneiform was
given up; clay tablets were no longer used. Aramaic became the
usual form of writing; ink used on sherds; wax tablets. Small bowls
often found with ink&ndash;written incantations in
Judaeo&ndash;Aramaic (see <a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig. 19). Mounds
of this period are
perhaps most easily recognized by the quantities of deep&ndash;blue
glazed sherds found lying about on them. The glaze is rather thin,
laid on a coarse drab ware, and is often cracked. The blue is very
fine, rivalling the old Egyptian. Burials of this period are often
found in (besides the shallow pottery coffins mentioned above)
rectangular oblong boxes of thin coarse ware with light friable
blue glaze (Babylon), or (later) in slipper&ndash;shaped coffins
(possibly Sassanian) of the same ware, rudely decorated with human
figures (warriors) in relief, on panels (Warka). The blue glaze has
often changed to a dark green, especially in the case of the Warka
slipper&ndash;coffins. The lids are cemented to the coffins.
Internments are now full length, the old custom of contraction
having been entirely abandoned [1]. Gold ornaments and pieces of
gold leaf, gold fillets, &amp;c., are not unfrequently found with
the bodies, besides armlets, toe and finger rings, &amp;c., of
silver and bronze, the finger&ndash;rings usually of ordinary Roman
types; pottery, lamps, and glass vessels. These coffins are often
in brick vaults, usually placed haphazard in the ground, as in
earlier times. Bricks small, hard, and yellow.</p>

<p><small>[1] The western custom of cremation was never adopted, in
spite of the Hellenization of culture. It offended both Babylonian
and Iranian sentiment, although the Parthians were never very
orthodox followers of Ahuramazda, and venerated (at least
platonically) the most popular deities of the Greek
pantheon.</small></p>

<p>2. <em>Sassanian Period; c.</em>220&ndash;650 A.D.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Reaction towards Oriental motives in
art: a typical <em>antka</em> of the period is the Sassanian seal
of cornelian, chalcedony, or haematite, in shape sometimes a ring,
more often a flat sphere with one&ndash;third cut off to form a
seal&ndash;base, perforated for stringing (see <a
href="#ill14">XIV</a>, Fig. 8), and
inscribed in Pehlevi (see <a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig. 20) a script
that to the
unitiated looks very like Cufie Arabic: the language is
Old&ndash;Persian, which was spoken by the court officials at
Ctesiphon, the language of the people being Aramaic. Sculpture
barbarized, but with a picturesque character of its own
(Nakhsh&ndash;i&ndash; Rustam, Tak&ndash;i&ndash;Bostn), sometimes
reminiscent of Indian work. Architecture: Parthian&ndash;Roman
traditions (Ctesiphon). Pottery usually glazed blue (thicker
glaze). Unglazed bowls with Hebrew and Mandaitic magical
inscriptions. Bronze no longer used except for coins. Objects from
mounds very like those of preceding age, but less of Roman origin.
Not much known of burials; the Warka slipper&ndash;coffins usually
regarded as Parthian may possibly be of early Sassanian age.</p>

<p>VII. L<small>ATER</small> I<small>RON</small>
A<small>GE</small>: <em>Muhammadan Period; c.</em>650&ndash;1500
A.D.[1]</p>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b> Development of art under Persian
influence till Tartar conquest in thirteenth century: the
destruction and depopulation of the country at that time brought
all real artistic development to an end. Flourishing period: the
'Abbsid Khalifate: ninth century: Hrn al&ndash;Rashd. Ruins of
the ancient city and palaces of Samarr: halls with modelled and
painted plaster&ndash;decorations, not only geometrical but also
(Persian heterodox influence) representing trees, birds, &amp;c. No
more sculpture in round or relief of human figures or animals. The
only survival of classical tradition would appear to be to some
extent in architecture: Greek architects.</p>

<p>Coins: thin gold, and silver, with Cufic inscriptions only (see
<a href="#ill15">XV</a>, Fig. 21). Mounds of this period may be known
by fragments of


marble&ndash;carving with Cufic inscriptions, plasterwork, Arab and
Persian vase and tile fragments in thick blue, green, yellow, or
brown glaze, metallic lustre&ndash;glaze, &amp;c., variegated glass
bangles, and rings; bits of cloudy white glass (from lamps);
fragments of wood, carved and inlaid with bone, nacre, &amp;c., in
geometrical patterns; textile fragments, (which are naturally not
commonly found in older mounds), &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nothing is said with regard to burials as these may not be
touched.</p>

<p>[1] The limit of age which constitutes an 'antiquity' for legal

<h3><a name="sum">LAWS OF ANTIQUITIES</a></h3>

<p>The following brief notes on the Laws of Antiquities in force in
the various territories with which this book is concerned must not
be taken as absolving the traveller from the necessity of
consulting the full text of the laws. At the time of going to
press, the Turkish Law presumably prevails in such parts of the
Turkish Empire as are not occupied by the troops of the Entente; in
the remainder, temporary regulations are in force which will
doubtless be modified when the new governments are established; and
it is possible that the Turkish Law itself may be brought into
greater harmony with modern ideas.</p>

<h4>The Greek Law of Antiquities.</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ill20.gif" width="90%"
border="0" alt="Greek script"></p>

<p>All antiquities found are the property of the Government and are
controlled by an Archaeological Commission, consisting of the Ephor
General of Antiquities and the ephors of the archaeological
collections in Athens. Fixed antiquities must be reported by the
discoverer to the Ephor General or one of the ephors of antiquities
or other official. Damaging of ruins or remains of monuments is
forbidden. Owners of the land on which portable antiquities
desirable for the National Museums are found are compensated to the
extent of half their value. Any person who finds antiquities on his
land must report them within five days, on pain of confiscation.
The same applies to any one who finds antiquities on another
person's land, or in any other way comes into possession of
antiquities. Informers against breaches of the law are rewarded by
the amount of the compensation due to those who keep the law.
Objects not considered worth keeping by the Museums are returned to
the owner of the land. Excavations, even on private property, must
be authorized by the Ministry of Education. The Government has the
right of expropriating land for purposes of excavation. In
Government excavations, the owner of the land receives
one&ndash;third of the value of the objects considered worth
keeping by the Museums. Secret excavation is punished by
confiscation of the finds, imprisonment and temporary loss of civil
rights. In authorized excavations by a landowner or his
representative the excavator receives half the value of the finds
taken by the Museums. Any one attempting to excavate on another
man's land is punished by imprisonment. Antiquities found in the
country may not be exported (on pain of imprisonment or fine and
temporary loss of civil rights) without permission, which is only
granted for objects not considered by the Archaeological Commission
to be of use to the Museums. Such objects on export are subject to
a tax of 10 percent. <em>ad valorem</em> unless declared entirely
valueless by the Commission. Antiquities imported into the country
must be declared in the Customs House and reported to the Ephor
General of Antiquities, a descriptive catalogue in duplicate being
sent, and cannot be re&ndash; exported without permission, which is
obtained by producing the articles with the original catalogue to
the Ephor General; if not reported they are regarded as having been
found in the country.</p>

<h4>The Turkish Law of Antiquities.</h4>

<p>Loi sur les Antiquits promulgue le 29 Sfer 1324 (10 Avril
1322).
Extrait du <em>Levant Herald</em> du 8, 9, 11 et 13 Juin
1906. Constantinople, Imprimerie du <em>Levant Herald,</em> Pera,
1906.</p>

<p>Antiquities are controlled by the Director&ndash;General of the
Imperial Museums and a Commission, the Directors of Public
Instruction in the provinces acting as agents. All ancient
monuments and objects (including those of Islamic date) are the
property of the Government. Any fixed antiquities discovered must
be reported under pain of fine within 15 days to the official in
charge of antiquities, or in his absence to the nearest civil or
military official. Punishment by fine and imprisonment is inflicted
for destroying or injuring monuments, measuring or making
impressions without authorization.</p>

<p>Transportable antiquities found on a man's land must be reported
by him within a week. The landowner receives half the value of
objects thus reported and bought by the State; objects not reported
are confiscated, and the landowner fined. This clause applies to
those who find antiquities on land belonging to other private
persons or to the State. Excavation is the exclusive privilege of
the Museums, but firmans may be obtained by scientific societies
and specialists. Unauthorized excavation is punished by
imprisonment and confiscation. The State has the right of making
preliminary soundings and of expropriation. Applications for leave
to excavate must be made to the Minister of Public Instruction. All
finds belong to the State. Unauthorized dealing in antiquities is
punishable by fine, imprisonment, and confiscation. Exportation of
antiquities found in the Empire is forbidden. Antiquities imported
must be reported to the directorate of antiquities, and may not be
sent from one part of the Empire to another, or re&ndash;exported,
without permission from the Director&ndash;General.</p>

<h4>The Cypriote Law of Antiquities.</h4>

<p>To Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Ancient Monuments
and Antiquities, and to provide Museums. Law no. IV of 1905. See
Sir J. T. Hutchinson and S. Fisher, <em>The Statute Laws of
Cyprus,</em> 1878&ndash;1906 (London, 1906), pp. 595&ndash;608.</p>

<p>Objects later than the Turkish conquest, and coins of Byzantine
or later times, are not deemed to be antiquities. All undiscovered
antiquities of movable character are the property of the
Government; all immovable antiquities are also the property of the
Government, unless some person shall be the owner of them. All
antiquities must be reported by the person in possession of them to
the Museum Committee, on pain of confiscation; antiquities found
except in the course of authorized excavations must be reported
within five days to the District Commissioner, One&ndash;third of
such movable antiquities is taken by the Government,
one&ndash;third by the finder, and one&ndash;third by the owner of
the land. Damage to ancient monuments is punished by fine or
imprisonment or both. Unauthorized excavation, even on land
belonging to the excavator, and the purchasing of objects illegally
excavated, are punished by fine or imprisonment or both.
Application for leave to excavate must be made to the Chief
Secretary for Government. All antiquities found in excavation
belong to the Government; only duplicates, and objects not required
by the Museum, are given to the excavator. The Government has the
right to expropriate land for the purpose of excavations. The
Museum Committee may acquire the interests of any private person in
an antiquity on payment of compensation. If the sum agreed on is
not paid within six months, the Museum Committee loses all right to
its acquisition. Export of antiquities is forbidden except with the
permission of the High Commissioner, which is granted only for
objects not required by the Museum or for antiquities the interests
in which the Museum Committee has failed to acquire in the manner
described.</p>

d'archologie orientala. 1913.</p>

<p>All antiquities belong to the State. The State has the right of
expropriating ground containing antiquities. Transportable
antiquities when found must be reported to nearest administrative
authority or agents of the Service of Antiquities: the finder
receives half the objects thus reported or their value. Excavation,
dealing in antiquities, and exportation are forbidden unless under
authorization. Destruction of and damage to antiquities is
punishable by fine and imprisonment. Applications for leave to
export or to excavate should be made to the Director&ndash;General
of Service of Antiquities. A tax of 1 &frac12; per cent. is levied
on the declared value of objects passed for export. Leave to
excavate is granted only to savants recommended by Governments or
learned societies, or to private persons presenting proper
guarantees. The excavator pays the cost of guarding the site. The
Government takes half the portable objects found.</p>

<h4>General Principles of a Model Law of Antiquities for the Near
and Middle East.</h4>

<p>The following statement of Principles which should form the
foundation of the Laws of Antiquities to be enacted for the various
Provinces formerly under Turkish rule was drawn up by an
International Committee in Paris and recommended to the Commission
for regulating the Mandates under the League of Nations. It follows
closely the Recommendations of the Archaeological Joint Committee
on the same subject. It was proposed at the same time that the
Treaty with Turkey should enjoin the adoption by that Power of a
Law of Antiquities on the same lines:</p>

<h4>Principes du reglement devant tre adopt par chacune des
Puissances
mandataires.</h4>

<p>1. 'ANTIQUIT' signifie toute construction, tout produit de
l'activite humaine, antrieur  l'anne 1700.</p>

<p>2. Toute personne qui, ayant dcouvert une antiquit, la signalera
a
un employ du Dpartement des Antiquits du pays, sera rcompense
suivant la valeur de l'objet, le principe  adopter devant tre
d'agir par encouragement plutt que par menace.</p>

<p>3. Aucun objet antique ne pourra tr vendu sauf au Departement
des
Antiquits du pays, mais si ce Dpartement renonce a l'acqurir la
vente en deviendra libre. Aucune antiquit ne pourra sortir du pays
sans un permis d'exportation dudit Dpartement.</p>

<p>4. Toute personne qui, exprs ou par ngligence, dtruira ou
dtriorera un objet ou une construction antique, devra tre passible
d'une peine  fixer par l'autorit du pays.</p>

<p>5. Aucun dblaiement ni aucune fouille ayant pour objet la
recherche
d'antiquits ne seront permis sous peine d'amende, sauf aux personnes
autorises par le Dpartement des Antiquits du pays.</p>

<p>6. Des conditions quitables devront tre fixes par chaque
Puissance
mandataire pour l'expropriation temporaire ou permanente des terrains
qui pourraient offrir un intrt historique ou archologique.</p>

<p>7. Les autorisations pour les fouilles ne devront tre accordes
qu'aux personnes qui offrent des garanties suffisantes d'exprience
archologique. Aucune des Puissances mandataires ne devra, en
accordant ces autorisations, agir de faon  carter, sans motif
valable, les savants des autres nations.</p>

<p>8. Les produits des fouilles pourront tre diviss entre le
fouilleur et le Dpartement des Antiquits de chaque pays dans une
proportion fixe par ce Departement. Si, pour des raisons
scientifiques, la division ne semble pas possible, le fouilleur devra
recevoir, au lieu d'une partie de la trouvaille, une juste
indemnit.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
